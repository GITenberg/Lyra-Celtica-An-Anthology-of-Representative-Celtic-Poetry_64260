introductory remarks: the appeal is in the wares, not in the running
commentary of the hawker. For those, however, who have looked for a
detailed synthesis, as well as for the Celticists who may have expected
an ample, or, at least, a more adequately representative selection from
the older Celtic literatures, I have a brief word to say before passing
on to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>In the first place, this volume is no more than an early, and, in a
sense, merely arbitrary, gleaning from an abundant harvest. For “Lyra
Celtica” is not so much the introduction to a much larger, more organic,
and more adequately representative work, to be called “Anthologia
Celtica,” but is rather the outcome of the latter, itself culled from a
vast mass of material, ancient, mediæval, and modern. It is, moreover,
intentionally given over mainly to modern poetry. “Anthologia Celtica”
may not appear for a year or two hence, perhaps not for several years;
for a systematic effort to compile a scholarly anthology, on
chronological and comparative lines, of the ancient poetry of Irish and
Scottish Gaeldom, of the Cymric, Armorican, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> Brythonic bards,
is a task not to be lightly undertaken, or fulfilled in anything like
satisfactory degree without that patience and care which only
enthusiastic love of the subject can give, and for which the extrinsic
reward is payable in rainbow-gold alone.</p>

<p>In the second place, all that was intended to be written here, will be
given more fully and more systematically in a volume to be published
later: “An Introduction to the Study of Celtic Literature.” Therein an
effort is made to illustrate the distinguishing imaginative qualities of
the several Celtic races; to trace the origins, dispersion, interfusion,
and concentration of the early Celtic, Picto-Celtic, and later Goidelic
and Brythonic peoples, and to reflect Celtic mythopœic and authentic
history through Celtic poetry and legendary lore. Concurrently there is
an endeavour to relate, in natural order, the development of the
literature of contemporary Wales, Brittany, Ireland, and Celtic
Scotland, from their ancient Cymric, Armorican, Erse, and Alban-Gaelic
congeners.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is not yet thirty years ago since Matthew Arnold published his
memorable and beautiful essay on Celtic Literature, so superficial in
its knowledge, it is true, but informed by so keen and fine an
interpretative spirit; yet already, since 1868, the writings of Celtic
specialists constitute quite a library.</p>

<p>Of recent years we have had many works of the greatest value in Celtic
ethnology, philology, history, archæology, art, legendary ballads and
romances, folk-lore, and literature. Of all the Celtic literatures, that
which was least known, when Arnold wrote, was the Scoto-Gaelic; but now
with books such as Skene’s “Celtic Scotland,” Campbell’s “Popular Tales
of the West Highlands,” with its invaluable supplementary matter, Dr
Cameron’s “Reliquiæ Celticæ,” and many others, there is no difficulty
for the would-be student. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span> it is impossible to overrate the value
of popular books at once so able, so trustworthy, and so readily
attainable, as Professor Rhys’s “Celtic Britain,” or Dr Douglas Hyde’s
“Story of Early Gaelic Literature”; while Breton literature, ancient or
modern, has found almost as many, and certainly as able and
enthusiastic, exponents as that of Wales or that of Ireland. In Ireland
there is, with Mr Standish Hayes O’Grady, Dr Douglas Hyde, Dr Sigerson,
and many more, quite an army of workers in every branch of Celtic
science and literature; in Scotland one less numerous perhaps, but not
less ardent and justly enthusiastic; and in Wales the old Cymric spirit
survives unabated, from the Butt of Anglesea to the marches of Hereford.
In Brittany there was, till the other day, Hersart de la Villemarqué,
and now there are M. de Jubainville, M. Loth, M. Anatole Le Braz, M.
Auguste Brizeux, Charles Le Goffic, Louis Tiercelin, and many more
philologists and other students, poets, romancists, and critics.
Cornwall has not been neglected, nor has Man, and even the outlying
fringe of Celtdom has found interpreters and expounders. In France the
“Revue Celtique”; in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, Gaelic or Welsh or
Anglo-Celtic periodicals and “Transactions,” stimulate a wider and
deeper interest, and do inestimable service. The writings of men such as
Renan, De Jubainville, Valroger, and other French Celticists: of
Windisch, Kuno Meyer, and other Germans: of English specialists such as
Mr Whitley Stokes, Mr Alfred Nutt, and others: these, together, and in
all their different ways of approach, are, along with the writings of
native specialists in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, accomplishing a work
greater than is now to be measured or even accurately apprehended.</p>

<p>To all who would know something authentic concerning the history of the
Celtic race since its occupation of these Isles, and of a large section,
and latterly of a corner, of Western Europe, I would recommend
Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> Rhys’s admirable little book, “Celtic Britain,” a volume
within the reach of all. In the Irish National Library, the volumes of
which are sold at a trifling sum, may be had Dr Douglas Hyde’s lucid and
excellent exposition of early Gaelic literature; and, among valuable
popular contributions to Anglo-Celtic Literature, mention should be made
of the Rev. Nigel MacNeill’s “Literature of the Highlanders.” These
three books alone, each priced at a moderate sum, will give a reader,
hitherto ignorant of the subject, much trustworthy information on the
history, ethnology, and literature of the Irish and Scottish Gael. I
know of no “popular” book on early Welsh literature, and certainly none
that, in trustworthiness, has superseded Stephens’s “Literature of the
Cymri.” Mr Norris has introduced us to much ancient Cornish writing
which it would have been a pity to let lapse uncollected: and of MM.
Villemarqué, De Jubainville, Valroger, Le Braz, and other Breton
specialists I have already spoken.</p>

<p>It would seem reserved for this coming century, says Dr Hyde, unless a
vigorous, sustained, and national effort at once be made, to catch the
last tones of “that beautiful, unmixed Aryan language which, with the
exception of that glorious Greek which has now renewed its youth like
the eagle, has left the longest, most luminous, and most consecutive
literary track behind it of any of the vernacular tongues of Europe.”
But, alas, a stronger law than that which man can make or unmake, or
nations can resolve, is slowly disintegrating the subsoil wherefrom the
roots of the Celtic speech draw the sole nurture which can give it the
beauty and fragrance of life.</p>

<p>Some idea of the vastness of the mass of the as yet untranslated Celtic
literature may be had from the notes in books by Dr Douglas Hyde, J. F.
Campbell, Alfred Nutt, and other specialists. In the National Libraries
in Great Britain alone it is estimated that, if all the inedited MSS.
were printed, they would fill at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span> least twelve hundred or fourteen
hundred octavo volumes. Those who would realise more adequately the
extent and importance of this early literature should, besides the
authorities already mentioned, consult Eugene O’Curry’s invaluable
“Manners and Customs,” and in particular the section of 130 pp. devoted
to Education and Literature in Ancient Erinn, which deals with the most
important Irish-Gaelic poets from the earliest times down to the
eleventh century: the likewise invaluable “Myvyrian Archaiology,” which
sets forth an imposing list of Cymric poets, with much information
concerning life in Ancient Wales: and books such as Campbell’s “Leabhar
na Féinne,” and “Tales of the West Highlands,” MacNeill’s “Literature of
the Highlanders,” and (though for students rather than the general
reader) the writings of Skene, Anderson, Whitley Stokes, Nutt, and many
others.</p>

<p>Modern Irish-Celtic literature may be said to date from O’Donovan’s
superb redaction and amplification of “The Annals of the Four Masters,”
one of the monumental achievements in world-literature, on the side of
scholarship; and from Keating’s “History of Ireland,” on the side of
popular writing. Since O’Donovan and Keating, the literary activity of
Ireland has again and again re-asserted itself, and is once more so much
in evidence, in Celtic scholarship and in Anglo-Celtic romance and
poetry, that the not over-ready attention of England is perforce drawn
to it.</p>

<p>The contemporary Anglo-Celtic poetry of Ireland has a quality which no
other English poetry possesses in like degree: the quality which Matthew
Arnold defined as natural magic&mdash;“Celtic poetry drenched in the dew of
natural magic.” Obviously, the lover of poetry may at once object that
Shakespere, Milton, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, are English, and Byron,
Burns, and Scott are Scottish, and not distinctively Anglo-Celtic. Well,
of Shakespere’s ancestry we know little; and if Celtic enthusiasts
maintain that he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi">{xxvi}</a></span> have had a strong Celtic strain in his blood,
they may be innocent blasphemers, but do not deserve crucifixion for
their iniquity. Milton was of Welsh blood through his maternal descent;
and Keats is a Celtic name. Keats’ mother’s name is Welsh of the Welsh,
while his genius is as convincingly Celtic in its distinguishing
qualities as though he were able to trace his descent from Oisìn or
Fergus Honey-Mouth of “the Fingalians.” Keats, born a Cockney, is
pre-eminently a Celtic poet, by virtue of the nationality of the brain
if for no other authentic reason; while Moore, born in Ireland of Celtic
ancestry, is the least Celtic of all modern poets of eminence. So far as
we know, Coleridge and Shelley are of unmixed English blood, though who
can say there was nothing atavistic in their genius, and that the wild
lyricism of the one and the glamour and magic of the other were not in
part the expression of some “ancestral voice”?</p>

<p>Of the three great modern Scots, it is still a debatable point if Burns
was not more Celtic than “Lowland,” that is, by paternal as well as by
maternal descent; and it surely is almost unquestionable that, in the
geography of the soul, Burns’ natal spot must be sought in the Fortunate
Isles of Celtdom. Byron, of course, though far more British than
Scottish, and again more Scottish than Celtic, had a strong Celtic
strain in his blood; and Scott, as it happens, was of the ancient stock,
and not “the typical Lowlander” he is so often designated.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The truth is, that just as in Scotland we may come upon a type which is
unmistakably national without being either Anglo-Saxon or Celtic or
Anglo-Celtic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii">{xxvii}</a></span> but which, rightly or wrongly, we take to be Pictish (and
possibly a survival of an older race still), so, throughout our whole
country, and in Sussex and Hampshire, as well as in Connemara or Argyll,
we may at any moment encounter the Celtic brain in the Anglo-Saxon
flesh. In Scotland, in particular, it may be doubted if there are many
families native to the soil who have not at least a Celtic strain.
People are apt to forget that Celtic Scotland does not mean only the
Western Isles and the Highlands, and that the whole country was at one
time Celtic (Goidelic), and before that was again Celtic, when Brythonic
or Cymric Scotland and the Dalriadic Scoto-Irish of Argyll, and the
northern Picts, who were probably Gaels, or of kindred Celtic origin,
held the land, and sowed the human seed whence arose much of the finest
harvest of a later Scotland.</p>

<p>Here I may conveniently quote a significant passage from “Celtic
Britain”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“This means, from the Celtic point of view, that the Goidelic race of
history is not wholly Celtic or Aryan, but inherits in part a claim to
the soil of these islands, derived from possession at a time when, as
yet, no Aryan waggoner had driven into Europe; and it is, perhaps, from
their Kynesian ancestry that the Irish of the present day have inherited
the lively humour and ready wit, which, among other characteristics,
distinguish them from the Celts of the Brythonic branch, most of whom,
especially the Kymry, are a people still more mixed, as they consist of
the Goidelic element of the compound nature already suggested, with an
ample mixture of Brythonic blood, introduced mostly by the Ordovices.
And as to Welsh, it is, roughly speaking, the Brythonic language, as
spoken by the Ordovices, and as learned by the Goidelic peoples they
overshadowed in the Principality of Wales. To this its four chief
dialects still correspond, being those, respectively, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxviii" id="page_xxviii">{xxviii}</a></span> Powys, Gwent
or Siluria, Dyved or Demetia, and Venedot or Gwynedd.</p>

<p>“Skulls are harder than consonants, and races lurk when languages slink
away. The lineal descendants of the neolithic aborigines are ever among
us, possibly even those of a still earlier race. On the other hand, we
can imagine the Kynesian impatiently hearing out the last echoes of
palæolithic speech; we can guess dimly how the Goidel gradually silenced
the Kynesian; we can detect the former coming slowly round to the
keynote of the Brython; and, lastly, we know how the Englishman is
engaged, linguistically speaking, in drowning the voice of both of them
in our own day. Such, to take another metaphor, are some of the lines
one would have to draw in the somewhat confused picture we have
suggested of one wave of speech chasing another, and forcing it to dash
itself into oblivion on the western confines of the Aryan world; and
that we should fondly dream English likely to be the last, comes only
from our being unable to see into a distant future pregnant with untold
changes of no less grave a nature than have taken place in the dreary
wastes of the past.”</p>

<p>To return: among the great English and Scottish writers of to-day two
may be taken as examples of this brain-kinship with a race physically
alien. Much of the poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne is distinctively
Celtic, particularly in its lyric fire and wonderful glow and colour, as
well as its epithetical luxuriance; but, indeed, this is hardly a good
instance after all, for Mr Swinburne’s north-country ancestry is not
without definite Celtic admixture. “Tristram of Lyonesse” is, in its own
way, as Celtic as “The Voyage of St Brendan,” and with more of innate
inevitableness than in those lovely Celtic reflections in the
essentially English brain of Tennyson, “The Dream” and “The Voyage of
Maelduin.”</p>

<p>As for Robert Louis Stevenson, come of Lowland<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxix" id="page_xxix">{xxix}</a></span> stock, and, as he said
himself once, “made up o’ Lallan dust, body and soul,” there is not, so
far as I know, any proof that a near paternal or maternal ancestor was
of Celtic blood. But who, that has studied his genius, can question the
Celtic strain in him, or who believe that, though “the Lallan dust” may
have been unadulterate for generations, the brain which conceived and
wrought “The Merry Men” and “Thrawn Janet” was not attuned to Celtic
music? There is a poem of his which seems to me typically Celtic in its
indescribable haunting charm, its air of I know not what rare music, its
deep yearning emotion, and its cosmic note&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxx" id="page_xxx">{xxx}</a></span></div></div>
</div>

<p>Of course there is a certain poignant note common to all poetry, and he
might be a zealous Celticist, but a poor worshipper of Apollo, who would
try to limit this charm of exquisite regret and longing to Celtic
poetry. It is an unfrontiered land, this pleasant country in the
geography of the soul which we call Bohemia; and here all parochial and
national, and even racial distinctions fall away, and Firdausi and
Oisìn, Omar the Tentmaker and Colum the Saint, and all and every
“Honey-Mouth” of every land and time, move in equal fellowship. Even in
one of the most haunting quatrains by any modern Anglo-Celtic poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“O wind, O mighty melancholy wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Blow through me, blow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou blowest forgotten things into my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">From long ago”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">we must not forget the elder music of one who is among the truest of the
poets of Nature whom the world has seen: though neither in brain nor, so
far as we know, in blood, had Wordsworth any kinship with the Celt&mdash;the
music “Of old, unhappy, far-off things.”</p>

<p>By a natural association, “Ossian” comes to mind. It is pleasant to
think that a book like “Lyra Celtica” appears just at the centenary of
James Macpherson. Macpherson died in 1796, but long before his death his
reputed “Ossian” had become one of the most vital influences in
literature. This is not the occasion to go into the “Ossian” dispute. It
must suffice to say that the concensus of qualified opinion decides&mdash;(1)
That Macpherson’s “Ossian” is not a genuine rendering of ancient
originals; (2) that he worked incoherently upon a genuine but
unsystematised, unsifted, and fragmentary basis, without which, however,
he could have achieved nothing; (3) that inherent evidence disproves
Macpherson’s sole or even main authorship as well as “Ossian’s,” and
that he was at most no more than a skilful artificer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxi" id="page_xxxi">{xxxi}</a></span> (4) that, if he
were the sole author, he would be one of the few poetic creators of the
first rank, and worthy of all possible honour; (5) that no single work
in our literature has had so wide-reaching, so potent, and so enduring
an influence.</p>

<p>Much of the tragic gloom, of which “Ossian” is a true mirror, colours
even contemporary Scoto-Celtic poetry; and though in Gaelic there is
much humorous verse, and much poetry of a blithe, bright, and even
joyous nature, the dominant characteristic is that of gloom, the gloom
of unavailing regret, of mournful longing, a lament for what cannot be
again. True, in a Gaelic poem by Mary Mackellar, a contemporary Highland
poet, we hear of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spioraid aosmhoir tìr nan Gàidheal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That hath waked thee from the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to triumph turned thy gloom?)&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">but, alas! that fine line, “Spioraid aosmhoir tìr nan Gàidheal” is not
an invocation to the Gaelic muse to arouse herself to a new and blither
music, but is simply part of some congratulatory lines of a “Welcome to
the Marquis of Lorne on his union with the Princess Louise”!<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The “Spirit of the Gaelic earth” does not make for mirth, as a rule, at
least in the Highlands, save in verse of a frankly Bacchanalian or
satiric kind.</p>

<p>In this, there is a marked contrast with the Irish-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxii" id="page_xxxii">{xxxii}</a></span>Gaelic, whose muse
is laughter-loving though ever with “dewy dark eyes.”</p>

<p>If, however, the blithe and delightful peasant poetry of Mr Alfred
Percival Graves, and that so beautifully translated and paraphrased by
Dr Douglas Hyde, be characteristically Irish, so also is such typically
Celtic poetry as this lyric by the latest Irish singer, Miss Moira
O’Neill&mdash;</p>

<p>When we come to examine the literature of the four great divisions of
the Celtic race, a vast survey lies before us, with innumerable vistas.
A lifetime might well be given to the study of any one of the ancient
Erse, Alban-Gaelic, Cymric, and Armorican literatures: a lifetime that
would yet have to leave much undiscovered, much unrelated. There is room
for every student. In old Irish literature alone, though so many
enthusiasts are now working towards its greater elucidation and the
transference of the better part of it into Anglo-Celtic literature,
there remain whole tracts, and even regions, of unexploited land. In a
score of ways, pioneers have been clearing the ground for us:
philologists like Windisch, Loth, Kuno Meyer, Whitley Stokes; literary
scholars like S. Hayes O’Grady, Campbell of Islay, Cameron of Brodick,
Dr Douglas Hyde; folklorists innumerable, in Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland; romancists like Standish O’Grady, who write across the angle of
the historic imagination, and romancists like W. B. Yeats, who write
across the angle of the poetic imagination; and poets, an ever-growing
band of sweet singers, who catch for us the fugitive airs, the exquisite
fleeting cadences, the haunting, indefinable music of an earlier day.</p>

<p>From Ireland the Neo-Celtic Renascence has extended through Gaeldom. The
concurrent Welsh development may be independent of this Irish influence,
and probably is: largely because the poetic imagination of the Cymri of
to-day was stirred from within, by the stimulus to the national genius
through the world-wide attention drawn by the publication of the
“Mabinogion,” as in turn the Gaelic imagination was stirred by the
incalculable influence of “Ossian”&mdash;an influence so great, so deep, so
wide-reaching, that, as already said, were Macpherson to be proved the
sole author, were it convincingly demonstrable that he was, not a more
or less confused and unscholarly interpreter, but himself a creator,
himself “Ossian,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxiv" id="page_xxxiv">{xxxiv}</a></span> would deserve to rank with the three or four great
ancients and moderns who have dug, deep and wide, new channels for the
surging flow of human thought. Possibly, at any rate, this may prove to
be one good reason for the independence of the Welsh development from
any Irish stimulus&mdash;an impulse from within always being more potent and
enduring than one from without; but, fundamentally, this independence is
due to an organic difference. In a word, the Celtic genius is broadly
divisible, even at this day, into two great sections: the Goidelic and
the Brythonic or Cymric&mdash;let us say, is represented by the Welsh Celt
and the Gaelic Celt. Those readers or students who approach the
literature of either, ancient or modern, but particularly the latter,
and expect to find identity both of sentiment and in method of
expression, will ultimately be as disappointed as one who should, with
the same idea, approach Spanish and Portuguese, or Dutch and German, or
Provençal and French. In every respect, save that of ancient kinship,
the Welsh and the Gaels differ materially. There is, perhaps, more
likeness between the Highlander and the Welshman than between the latter
and the Irishman; but even here the distinctions are considerable, and
the Gaelic islesman of Barra or Uist is as different a creature from the
native of Glamorgan or Caermarthen as though no racial cousinship united
them. But, in the instance of Welsh and Irish, the unlikeness is so
marked that the best analogue is that of the Frenchman and the German.
The Irish are the French of the Celtic races, the Welsh the Germans. The
two people are distinct in their outer and inner life as well as in
their literature; and for a Connaught man or a Hebridean to go through
Wales would be as foreign an experience as for a Welshman to find
himself among the Catholic islesmen of South Uist, or among the moorside
villages of Connemara.</p>

<p>To-day the Gael and Cymri are foreigners. Strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxv" id="page_xxxv">{xxxv}</a></span> enough, the section
of the Celtic race most akin to the Welsh is the Manx&mdash;a Goidelic
people, and with a Gaelic dialect. The Gael himself, however, does not
stand out distinctly. Although there is a far greater likeness between
the Scoto-Celt and the Irish-Celt than between either and the Welshman,
there are traits which unmistakably distinguish them. In Ireland itself,
the Celt of the south-east and south differs in more respects than mere
dialect from his kinsman by the Connaught shore or of the hills of
Connemara; as, in Scotland, there is a marked distinction between the
“Tuathach” (North Highlander) and the “Deasach” (the South and West
Highlander). A Farquharson or a Gordon from Aberdeenshire has to shake
hands across the arms of many a Mackenzie and Macgregor, many a Cameron
and Macpherson, before he can link in brotherly grip with a MacNeill of
Barra, a Macdonald of Skye, a Macleod of the Lewis. These distinctions,
of course, are in their nature parochial rather than racial; but they
are highly indicative of a fundamental weakness in the Celtic nature,
and suggest a cogent reason for the failure of the race to cohere into
one compact and indispersable nation, as the central Teutonic races
merged into “Germany,” as Gauls, Normans, and Provençals merged into
“France,” and as the Brythons, the Teutonic outlanders (Frisians,
Angles, Jutes, &amp;c.), Saxons, Danes, Normans, and Anglo-Celts merged into
“England,” and, later, into “Great Britain,” into the “British Empire.”</p>

<p>The most marked Celtic national homogeneity is to be found in Wales.
Wales has ever persisted, and still persists in her moat and her
drawbridge. In the preservation of her language is her safeguard.
Without Welsh, Wales would be as English as Cumberland or Cornwall. In
this way only, knit indissolubly to the flank of England as she is, and
without any natural eastern frontier of mountain range or sea, can she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxvi" id="page_xxxvi">{xxxvi}</a></span>
isolate herself; and I am convinced that herein we have one main reason
for the passionate attachment of the Cymri of to-day to their ancient
language&mdash;an attachment as strong among the unlettered as among ardent
scholars, and even among those who have no heed for the beauty of
traditional literature or, indeed, heed of any kind other than for the
narrow personal interests of domesticity.</p>

<p>But this very isolation of Wales, through her language, has, no doubt,
interfered materially with the development of her Anglo-Celtic
literature. Contrasted with that of Ireland or that of Scotland, how
astonishingly meagre it is. All Ireland is aflame with song; Scotland is
again becoming the land of old romance. Here and there are a few
writers, a poet-romancist like Mr Ernest Rhys, a poet like the late
Emily Davis, a few novelists who are Welsh by the accident of birth
rather than by the nationality of the brain. For, of course, Mr George
Meredith stands so far above all localisation of this kind that it would
be out of place to rank him merely as the head of contemporary Wales. He
is the foremost Anglo-Celtic voice of to-day; so emphatically foremost,
by the distinguishing qualities of his genius, that if to-morrow he were
proved to be come of a stock of long unmixed Saxon ancestry never
dissociated from that southern country of which he is by birth a native,
we should be justified in abiding by the far more significant and
important lineage of the brain.</p>

<p>But this great exception apart, the difference alluded to is
extraordinary. Wales is so animated by national enthusiasms, pride, and
incalculable hereditary uplift, that her silence&mdash;in English, that
is&mdash;can hardly be accounted for away from the supposition that, in
closing her ears against English, she has also set her lips against
utterance in that tongue.</p>

<p>The Scoto-Celtic writers of to-day, both in prose and poetry, have
produced more Anglo-Celtic literature than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxvii" id="page_xxxvii">{xxxvii}</a></span> Wales has done since the
beginning of the century, and with a range, a vitality, a beauty, far
beyond anything that has come forth from modern Cymru; and Ireland,
again, in poetry at any rate, has given us even more than Scotland.</p>

<p>The Celtic Renascence, of which so much has been written of late&mdash;that
is, the re-birth of the Celtic genius in the brain of Anglo-Celtic poets
and the brotherhood of dreamers&mdash;is, fundamentally, the outcome of
“Ossian,” and, immediately, of the rising of the sap in the Irish
nation.</p>

<p>Of the immense and never yet approximately defined Irish-Celtic
influence in literature a fine and true word has been said by one of the
ablest of the Irish fellowship; and I would strongly urge every reader
to obtain Mr Stopford Brooke’s admirable and stimulating little essay
“On the Need and Use of getting Irish Literature into the English
Tongue.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> With its conclusion, every lover of English poetry and
romance will agree.</p>

<p>“When we have got the old [Celtic] legendary tales rendered into fine
prose and verse, I believe we shall open out English poetry to a new and
exciting world, an immense range of subjects, entirely fresh and full of
inspiration. Therefore, as I said, get them out into English, and then
we may bring England and [Celtdom] into a union which never can suffer
separation, and send another imaginative force on earth which may (like
Arthur’s tale) create Poetry for another thousand years.”</p>

<p>These are inspiring words, and should find an eager response.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxviii" id="page_xxxviii">{xxxviii}</a></span></p>

<p>More and more we may hope that the beautiful poetry of Ireland, ancient
and modern, with its incommunicable charm and exquisite spontaneity;
that the strange, elemental, sombre imagination of the West Highlander
and of the Gael of the Isles; and that the vivid spell of the old Welsh
bards, will, before long, become a still greater, a still more
regenerating, and a lasting force and influence in our English
literature.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the Notes I have something to say concerning each of the many ancient
and modern writers drawn upon for this representative anthology, so need
not here enter into further detail of the kind.</p>

<p>Obviously, it would be impossible to make a work of this nature as
welcome to the Celtic scholar as to the general reader. No one in the
least degree acquainted with ancient Gaelic and Cymric literature could
fail to note how merely superficial this section of “Lyra Celtica” is.
Therefore, let me again aver that this anthology has been compiled, not
for the specialist, but for the lover of poetry; and to serve, for the
many who have no knowledge of “Anglo-Celtic” as distinct from
“Anglo-Saxon” poetry, as a small Pisgah whence to gain a glimpse into a
strange and beautiful land, a land wherein, as in a certain design by
William Blake, the sun, the moon, and the morning star all shine
together, and where the horizons are spanned by fugitive rainbows ever
marvellously dissolving and more marvellously re-forming.</p>

<p>The effort of the Editor has been to give, not always the finest or most
unquestionably authentic examples of early Celtic poetry, but the most
characteristic. Thus only could some idea be conveyed of the physiognomy
of this ancient literature.</p>

<p>In the first section, that representative of Early Gaelic, a long period
of time is covered. A whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxxix" id="page_xxxix">{xxxix}</a></span> heroic age lies between that strange
pantheistic utterance of Amergin, who is now accepted as the earliest
Erse poet of whom we have authentic record, and the hymns of Columba:
and the quaint “Shaving Hymn” of Murdoch the Monk, though it precedes
the Ossianic fragments, relates to a much nearer period of history than
they do. Of these Ossianic fragments, it is not needful to say more here
than that, in their actual form, they are no more genuinely old than,
for example, are many of the lovely fantasias on old themes by modern
Irish poets. They are, at most, fundamentally ancient, and are given
here on this plea, and not as the translations of Macpherson. The day is
gone when the stupid outcry against Macpherson’s “Ossian,” as no more
than a gigantic fraud, finds a response among lovers of literature. We
all know, now, that Macpherson’s “Ossian” is not a genuine translation
of authentic <span class="gesh">Dana Oisìn mhic Fhionn</span>, but, for all its great and enduring
beauty, a clumsily-constructed, self-contradictory, and sometimes
grotesquely impossible rendering of disconnected, fugitive, and, for the
most part, oral lore. Of the genuineness of this legendary lore there is
no longer any doubt in the minds of those native and alien students, who
alone are qualified to pronounce a definite verdict on this long
disputed point. It would have been easy to select other Ossianic
fragments; but as, in this anthology, the spirit and not the letter was
everything, it was considered advisable to make as apt a compromise with
Macpherson’s “Ossian” as practicable. Ancient poetry of the nature of
pieces such as “The Song of Fionn” (page 4) convey little to the
ordinary reader, not only on account of their puzzling allusions to
events and persons of whom the Englishman is not likely to have heard,
or from the strangeness of their style, as because of the remoteness of
the underlying sentiment and mental standpoint. And of this there can be
no<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xl" id="page_xl">{xl}</a></span> question: that the ancient poetry, the antique spirit, breathes
throughout this eighteenth-century restoration, and gives it enduring
life, charm, and all the spell of cosmic imagination. It may well be,
indeed, that the literary historian has another signal discovery to
make, and, in definitively dissociating Oisìn of the Féinn and Ossian of
Badenoch, prove convincingly that James Macpherson was not even the
author (of the greater part at any rate) of the matter that has been
interpolated into the original, inchoate, traditional bardic lore.</p>

<p>However much or little appeal “Ossian” may have for English readers of
to-day, there can surely be no doubt that all who have the spirit of
poetry must recognise the charm of the ancient Celtic imagination in
compositions such as “Credhe’s Lament” (page 5). This lovely haunting
lament, from the “Book of Lismore,” comes in its English form from that
invaluable work of Mr S. Hayes O’Grady, “Silva Gadelica.” Of how much
Celtic poetry, modern as well as ancient, is not this, though variously
expressed, the refrain: “Melodious is the crane, and O melodious is the
crane, in the marshlands of Druim-dá-thrén! ’tis she that may not save
her brood alive!”</p>

<p>For the remarkable continuity of both expression and sentiment which
characterises Celtic poetry, ancient and modern, let the student turn,
for example, to the most famous Gaelic poem in Scotland to-day, Duncan
Bàn Macintyre’s “Ben Dorain,” and compare it with this “Lay of Arran” by
Caeilte, the Ossianic bard&mdash;Arran, no longer Arran of the many stags,
but still one of the loveliest of the Scottish isles, and touched on
every headland and hill with the sunset glamour of the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xli" id="page_xli">{xli}</a></span></p>

<h2>CAEILTE&mdash;LAY OF ARRAN.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Arran of the many stags&mdash;the sea impinges on her very shoulders!
an island in which whole companies were fed&mdash;and with ridges among
which blue spears were reddened! Skittish deer are on her
pinnacles, soft blackberries upon her waving heather; cool water
there is upon her rivers, and mast upon her russet oaks! Greyhounds
there were in her, and beagles; blaeberries and sloes of the
blackthorn; dwellings with their backs set close against her woods,
and the deer fed scattered by her oaken thickets! A crimson crop
grew on her rocks, in all her glades a faultless grass; over her
crags affording friendly refuge, leaping went on and fawns were
skipping! Smooth were her level spots&mdash;her wild swine they were
fat; cheerful her fields (this is a tale that may be credited), her
nuts hung on her forest hazel’s boughs, and there was sailing of
long galleys past her! Right pleasant their condition all when the
fair weather sets in: under her rivers’ brinks trouts lie; the
sea-gulls wheeling round her grand cliff answer one the other&mdash;at
every fitting time delectable is Arran!”</p></div>

<p>Again, most readers will be able to apprehend the delight of the
barbaric outlook in compositions such as “Cuchullin in His Chariot,”
which has been excerpted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlii" id="page_xlii">{xlii}</a></span> from Hector MacLean’s “Ultonian Hero Ballads”;
or the fantastic beauty of “The March of the Faerie Host,” as rendered
by Prof. Kuno Meyer after the original in “The Book of Lismore”; or the
lovely portrait of a beautiful woman, by a Highland poet of old, the
“Aisling air Dhreach Mna; or, Vision of a Fair Woman.” Possibly, too,
even Celtic scholars may not be displeased to read here English metrical
paraphrases, such as Sir Samuel Ferguson’s “Lament of Deirdrê for the
Sons of Usnach,”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or Mr T. W. Rolleston’s haunting “The Lament of
Queen Maev”; or, again, in dubiously authentic fragments such as “Fingal
and Ros-crana,” to have an opportunity to trace the “inner self” of many
a familiar ballad or legend.</p>

<p>The Breton section, also, is represented equally slightly, though
perhaps not inadequately, all things considered. “The Dance of the
Sword” is, probably, fundamentally one of the most ancient of Celtic
bardic utterances. In the modern selection, it will be a surprise to
many readers to encounter names so familiar to lovers of French poetry
as Leconte de Lisle and Villiers de l’Isle-Adam. There are many
contemporary Breton poets of distinction, but it was feasible to select
no more than one or two. Auguste Brizeux and Charles Le Goffic may be
taken as typical exemplars of the historically re-creative and the
individually impressionistic methods. Unfortunately neither is
represented here. It was desirable to select at least one poet who still
uses the old Armorican tongue; but in my translation from
Leo-Kermorvan’s “Taliesen” (as again in that of Tiercelin’s “By Menec’hi
Shore”), I have not attempted a rhymed version, as in the original, or
in the French version<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xliii" id="page_xliii">{xliii}</a></span> published in the “Anthologie.” There are very few
translators who can be faithful both to the sound and sense, in the
attempt concurrently to reproduce identity of form, music, and
substance; and, as a rule, therefore, rhythmic prose, or an unrhymed
metrical version, is likely to prove more interesting as well as more
truly interpretative.</p>

<p>Out of the rich garth of ancient and mediæval Welsh poetry, the Editor
has culled only a few blossoms. They contain, at least, something of
that lyric love of Nature which is so distinctively Celtic, and is the
chief charm of the poetic literature of Wales. It is earnestly to be
hoped that some poet-scholar will give us before long, in English, an
anthology of the best contemporary Welsh poetry.</p>

<p>Of living poets who write in Gaelic, there are more in Scotland than in
Ireland. The Hebrides have been a nest of singers, since Mary Macleod
down to the youngest of the Uist poets of to-day; and though there is
not at present any Alexander Macdonald or Duncan Bàn Macintyre, there
are many singers who have a sweet and fine note, and many writers whose
poems have beauty, grace, and distinction. Perhaps the last fine product
of the pseudo-antique school is the “Sean Dàna”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of Dr John Smith,
late in the last century; but occasionally there occurs in our own day a
noteworthy instance of the re-telling of the old tales in the old way.
In “The Celtic Monthly,” and other periodicals, much good Gaelic verse
is to be found, and it is no exaggeration to say that at this moment
there are more than a hundred Gaelic singers in Western Scotland whose
poetry is as fresh and winsome, and, in point of form as well as
substance, as beautiful, as any that is being produced throughout the
rest of the realm. The Gaelic Muse has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xliv" id="page_xliv">{xliv}</a></span> also found a home in Canada, and
it is interesting to note that one of the longest of recent Gaelic poems
was written by a Highlander in far-away Burmah.</p>

<p>“The Highlander” (and in this and the following passage I quote the
words of Professor Mackinnon, from his Inaugural Address on his
succession to the Celtic Chair at Edinburgh University) “The Highlander
may be truly described as the child of music and song. For many a long
year his language is the language, for the most part, of the uneducated
classes. And yet, amid surroundings which too often are but mean and
wretched, without the advantages of education beyond what his native
glen supplied, he has contrived to enliven his lot by the cultivation of
such literature as the local bards, the traditions of the clan, and the
popular tales of the district supplied. He has attempted, not
unsuccessfully, to live not for the day and hour alone, but, in a true
sense, to live the life of the spirit! He has produced a mass of lyric
poetry which, in rhythmical flow, purity of sentiment, and beauty of
expression, can compare favourably with the literature of more powerful
and more highly-civilised communities.</p>

<p>“In the highest efforts of Gaelic literature, in the prose of Norman
Macleod, in the masterpieces of the lyric poets, in the “Sean Dàna” of
Dr Smith, and above all, in the poems of Ossian, whether composed by
James Macpherson or the son of Fingal, the intellect of the Scottish
Celt, in its various moods and qualities, finds its deepest and fullest
expression. Here we have humour, pathos, passion, vehemence, a rush of
feeling and emotion not always under restraint, and apt to run into
exaggeration and hyperbole&mdash;characteristics which enter largely into the
mental and spiritual organisation of the people. But above and beneath
all these, there is a touch of melancholy, a ‘cry of the weary,’
pervading the spirit of the Celt. Ossian gives expression to this
sentiment in the touching line which Matthew Arnold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlv" id="page_xlv">{xlv}</a></span> the most
sympathetic and penetrating critic of the Celtic imagination, with the
true instinct of genius, prefixes to his charming volume, ‘On the Study
of Celtic Literature’:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>They went forth to the war, but they always fell.’<span class="lftspc">”</span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Professor Mackinnon goes on to adduce a familiar legend, which may again
be quoted, for we are all now waiting for that longed-for blast which
shall arouse the spell-bound trance wherein sleeps “Anima Celtica.” The
<span class="gesh">Féinn</span>, he says, were laid spell-bound in a cave which no man knew of. At
the mouth of the cave hung a horn, which if ever any man should come and
blow three times, the spell would be broken, and the <span class="gesh">Féinn</span> would arise,
alive and well. A hunter, one day wandering in the mist, came on this
cave, saw the horn, and knew what it meant. He looked in and saw the
<span class="gesh">Féinn</span> lying asleep all round the cave. He lifted the horn and blew one
blast. He looked in again, and saw that the <span class="gesh">Féinn</span> had wakened, but lay
still with their eyes staring, like those of dead men. He took the horn
again, blew another blast, and instantly the <span class="gesh">Féinn</span> all moved, each
resting on his elbow. Terrified at their aspect, the hunter turned and
fled homewards. He told what he had seen, and, accompanied by friends,
went to search for the cave. They could not find it; it has never again
been found; and so there still sit, each resting on his elbow, waiting
for the final blast to rouse them into life, the spell-bound heroes of
the old Celtic world.</p>

<p>Of the modern and larger section of “Lyra Celtica” I need say little
here. To avoid confusion, the Editor has refrained from representing
poets whose “Celtic strain” is more or less obviously disputable; hence
the wise ignoring of the claims even of Scott and Burns. Byron was more
Celtic in blood than in brain, and is represented really by virtue of
this accidental kinship.</p>

<p>Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Man, Cornwall, and Brit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xlvi" id="page_xlvi">{xlvi}</a></span>tany are all more or
less adequately represented; and among the poets are some whose voices
will be new to most readers. One or two writers, also, have been drawn
upon as representatives of the distinctively Anglo-Celtic section of
England. Finally, “greater Gaeldom”&mdash;the realm of the Irish and Scottish
Gaels in the United States, Canada, and Australasia&mdash;is also
represented; and one, at any rate, of these outlanders is a poet who has
won distinction on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>If it be advisable to select one poet, still “with a future,” as
pre-eminently representative of the Celtic genius of to-day, I think
there can be little doubt that W. B. Yeats’ name is that which would
occur first to most lovers of contemporary poetry. He has grace of touch
and distinction of form beyond any of the younger poets of Great
Britain, and there is throughout his work a haunting beauty, and a
haunting sense of beauty everywhere perceived with joy and longing, that
make its appeal irresistible for those who feel it at all. He is equally
happy whether he deals with antique or with contemporary themes, and in
almost every poem he has written there is that exquisite remoteness,
that dream-like music, and that transporting charm which Matthew Arnold
held to be one of the primary tests of poetry, and, in particular, of
Celtic poetry.</p>

<p>As an example of Mr Yeats’ narrative method, with legendary themes, I
may quote this from his beautiful “Wanderings of Oisìn” (rather
affectedly and quite needlessly altered to <span class="gesh">Usheen</span> in the latest
version)&mdash;</p>

<p>“No other human tribe,” says Renan, “has carried so much mystery into
love. No other has conceived with more delicacy the ideal of woman, nor
been more dominated by her. It is a kind of intoxication, a madness, a
giddiness. Read the strange <span class="gesh">mabinogi</span> of ‘Pérédur,’ or its French
imitation, ‘Parceval le Gallois’; these pages are dewy, so to say, with
feminine sentiment. Woman appears there as a sort of vague vision
intermediate between man and the supernatural world. There is no other
literature which offers anything analogous to this. Compare Guinevere
and Iseult to those Scandinavian furies Gudruna and Chrimhilde, and you
will acknowledge that woman, as chivalry conceived her&mdash;that ideal of
sweetness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_l" id="page_l">{l}</a></span> beauty set up as the supreme object of life&mdash;is a
creation neither classic, Christian, nor Germanic, but in reality
Celtic.”</p>

<p>And having quoted from Ernest Renan, himself one of the greatest of
modern Celts, and a Celt in brain and genius as well as by blood, race,
and birth, let me interpolate here a paraphrase of some words of his in
that essay on “La Poesie de la Race Celtique,” which was to intellectual
France what Matthew Arnold’s essay was to intellectual England.</p>

<p>If, he says, the eminence of races should be estimated according to the
purity of their blood and inviolability of national character, there
could be none able to dispute supremacy with the Celtic race. Never has
human family lived more isolated from the world, nor less affected by
foreign admixture.</p>

<p>Restricted by conquest to forgotten isles and peninsulas, the Celtic
race has habitually striven to oppose an impassable barrier to all alien
influences. It has ever trusted in itself, and in itself alone, and has
drawn its mental and spiritual nurture from its own resources.</p>

<p>Hence that powerful individuality, that hatred of the stranger, which up
to our day has formed the essential characteristic of the Celtic
peoples. The civilisation of Rome hardly reached them, and left among
them but few traces. The Germanic invasion flowed back on them, but it
did not affect them at all. At the present hour they still resist an
invasion, dangerous in quite another way, that of modern civilisation,
so destructive of local varieties and national types. Ireland in
particular (and there, perhaps, is the secret of her irremediable
weakness) is the sole country of Europe where the native can produce
authentic documents of his remote unbroken lineage, and designate with
certainty, up to pre-historic ages, the race from which he sprang.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_li" id="page_li">{li}</a></span></p>

<p>One does not enough reflect on how strange it is that an ancient race
should continue down to our day, and almost under our eyes, in some
islands and peninsulas of the West, its own life, more and more diverted
from it, it is true, by the noise from without, but still faithful to
its language, its memories, its ideals, and its genius. We are
especially apt to forget that this small race, contracted now to the
extreme confines of Europe, in the midst of those rocks and mountains
where its enemies have driven it, is in possession of a literature,
which in the Middle Ages exerted an immense influence, changed the
current of European imagination, and imposed upon almost the whole of
Christianity its poetical motifs. It is, however, only necessary to open
authentic monuments of Celtic genius to convince oneself that the race
which created these has had its own original method of thought and
feeling; and that nowhere does the eternal illusion dress itself in more
seductive colours. In the grand concert of the human species, no family
equals this, for penetrating voices which go to the heart. Alas! if it,
also, is condemned to disappear, this fading glory of the West! Arthur
will not return to his enchanted isle, and Saint Patrick was right in
saying to Ossian: “The heroes whom you mourn are dead; can they live
again?”</p>

<p>A strange melancholy characterises the genius of the Celtic race. For
all the blithe songs and happy abandon of so many Irish singers, the
Irish themselves have given us the most poignant, the most
hauntingly-sad lyric cries in all modern literature. Renan fully
recognises this, and how, even in the heroic age, the melancholy of
inappeasible regret, of insatiable longing, is as obvious as in our own
day, when spiritual weariness is as an added crown of thorns. Whence
comes this sadness, he asks? Take the songs of the sixth century bards;
they mourn more defeats than they sing victories. The history of the
Celtic race itself is but a long com<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_lii" id="page_lii">{lii}</a></span>plaint, the lament of exiles, the
grief of despairing flights beyond the seas. If occasionally it seems to
make merry, a tear ever lurks behind the smile; it rarely knows that
singular forgetfulness of the human state and of its destinies which is
called gaiety. But, if its songs of joy end in elegies, nothing equals
the delicious sadness of these national melodies.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, concludes the most famous of modern Breton writers, we are
still far from believing that the Celtic race has said its last word.
After having exercised all the godly and worldly chivalries, sought with
Pérédur the Holy Graal and the Beautiful, dreamed with Saint Brandan of
mystical Atlantides, who knows what the Celtic genius would produce in
the domain of the intelligence if it should embolden itself to make its
entrance into the world, and if it subjected its rich and profound
nature to the conditions of modern thought? Few races have had a
poetical infancy as complete as the Celtic&mdash;mythology, lyricism, epic,
romanesque imagination, religious enthusiasm, nothing have they lacked.
Why should philosophic thought be lacking? Germany, which had begun by
science and criticism, has finished with poetry; why should not the
Celtic races, which began with poetry, not end with a new and vivid
criticism of actual life as it now is? It is not so far from the one to
the other as we are apt to suppose; the poetical races are the
philosophical races, and philosophy is at bottom but a manner of poetry
like any other. When one thinks that Germany fronted, less than a
century ago, the revelation of its genius; that everywhere national
idiosyncrasies, which seemed effaced, have suddenly risen again in our
day more alive than ever, one is persuaded that it is rash to set a law
for the discontinuances and awakenings of races. Modern civilisation,
which seemed made to absorb them, may, perhaps, be but the forcing-house
for a new and more superb efflorescence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_liii" id="page_liii">{liii}</a></span></p>

<p>No, it is no “disastrous end”: whether the Celtic peoples be slowly
perishing or are spreading innumerable fibres of life towards a richer
and fuller, if a less national and distinctive existence. From Renan,
the high priest of the Breton faith, to the latest of his kindred of the
Gael, there is a strange new uprising of hope. It is realised that the
Dream is nigh dreamed: and then ...</p>

<span class="i0">Respect the realm of Mysteries.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Let me conclude, then, in the words of the most recent of those many
eager young Celtic writers whose songs and romances are charming the now
intent mind of the Anglo-Saxon. “A doomed and passing race. Yes, but not
wholly so. The Celt has at last reached his horizon. There is no shore
beyond. He knows it. This has been the burden of his song since Malvina
led the blind Oisìn to his grave by the sea. ‘Even the Children of Light
must go down into darkness.’ But this apparition of a passing race is no
more than the fulfilment of a glorious resurrection before our very
eyes. For the genius of the Celtic race stands out now with averted
torch, and the light of it is a glory before the eyes, and the flame of
it is blown into the hearts of the mightier conquering people. The Celt
falls, but his spirit rises in the heart and the brain of the
Anglo-Celtic peoples, with whom are the destinies of the generations to
come.”</p>

that the blackbird makes in Letterlee. A woeful sound, and O a woeful

that by my side he is in dead man’s form! That the wave should have
swept over his white body&mdash;that is what hath distracted me, so great was
his delightfulness. A dismal roar, and O a dismal roar, is that the
shore-surf makes upon the strand! seeing that the same hath drowned the
comely noble man, to me it is an affliction that Cael ever sought to
encounter it. A woeful booming, and O a boom of woe, is that which the
wave makes upon the northward beach! beating as it does against the
polished rock, lamenting for Cael, now that he is gone. A woeful fight,
and O a fight of woe, is that the wave wages against the southern shore!
As for me my span is determined!... A woeful melody, and O a melody of
woe, is that which the heavy surge of Tullachleish emits! As for me: the
calamity that is fallen upon me having shattered me, for me prosperity
exists no more. Since now Crimthann’s son is drowned, one that I may

<h3>Fingal and Ros-crana.</h3>

<p class="nind">ROS-CRANA.</p>

<p>By night, came a dream to Ros-crana! I feel my beating soul. No vision
of the forms of the dead came to the blue eyes of Erin. But, rising from
the wave of the north, I beheld him bright in his locks. I beheld the
son of the king. My beating soul is high. I laid my head down in night:
again ascended the form. Why delayest thou thy coming, young rider of
stormy waves!</p>

<p>But, there, far-distant, he comes; where seas roll their green ridges in
mist! Young dweller of my soul; why dost thou delay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">FINGAL.</p>

<p>It was the soft voice of Moi-lena! the pleasant breeze of the valley of
roes! But why dost thou hide thee in shades? Young love of heroes, rise.
Are not thy steps covered with light? In thy groves thou appearest,
Ros-crana, like the sun in the gathering of clouds. Why dost thou hide
thee in shades? Young love of heroes, rise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">ROS-CRANA.</p>

<p>My fluttering soul is high! Let me turn from steps of the king. He has
heard my secret voice, and shall my blue eyes roll in his presence? Roe
of the hill of moss, toward thy dwelling I move. Meet me, ye breezes of
Mora! as I move through the valley of the winds. But why should he
ascend his ocean? Son of heroes, my soul is thine! my steps shall not
move to the desert; the light of Ros-crana is here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">FINGAL.</p>

<p>It was the light tread of a ghost, the fair dweller of eddying winds.
Why deceivest thou me with thy voice?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> Here let me rest in shades.
Shouldst thou stretch thy white arm from thy grove, thou sunbeam of
Cormac of Erin&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">ROS-CRANA.</p>

<p>He is gone; and my blue eyes are dim; faint-rolling, in all my tears.
But, there, I behold him, alone; king of Selma, my soul is thine. Ah me!
what clanging of armour! Colc-ulla of Atha is near!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<h3>The Night-Song of the Bards.</h3>

<p>[Five bards passing the night in the house of a chief, who was a poet
himself, went severally to make their observations on, and returned with
an extempore description of, night.]</p>

<p class="nind">FIRST BARD.</p>

<p>Night is dull and dark. The clouds rest on the hills. No star with green
trembling beam; no moon looks from the sky. I hear the blast in the
wood, but I hear it distant far. The stream of the valley murmurs; but
its murmur is sullen and sad. From the tree at the grave of the dead the
long-howling owl is heard. I see a dim form on the plain! It is a ghost!
it fades, it flies. Some funeral shall pass this way: the meteor marks
the path.</p>

<p>The distant dog is howling from the hut of the hill. The stag lies on
the mountain moss: the hind is at his side. She hears the wind in his
branchy horns. She starts, but lies again.</p>

<p>The roe is in the cleft of the rock; the heath-cock’s head is beneath
his wing. No beast, no bird is abroad, but the owl and the howling fox:
she on a leafless tree; he in a cloud on the hill.</p>

<p>Dark, panting, trembling, sad, the traveller has lost his way. Through
shrubs, through thorns, he goes, along the gurgling rill. He fears the
rock and the fen. He fears the ghost of night. The old tree groans to
the blast; the falling branch resounds. The wind drives the withered
burrs, clung together, along the grass. It is the light tread of a
ghost! He trembles amidst the night.</p>

<p>Dark, dusky, howling, is night, cloudy, windy, and full of ghosts! The
dead are abroad! my friends, receive me from the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">SECOND BARD.</p>

<p>The wind is up, the shower descends. The spirit of the mountain shrieks.
Woods fall from high. Windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> flap.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The growing river roars. The
traveller attempts the ford. Hark! that shriek! he dies! The storm
drives the horse from the hill, the goat, the lowing cow. They tremble
as drives the shower, beside the shouldering bank.</p>

<p>The hunter starts from sleep, in his lonely hut; he wakes the fire
decayed. His wet dogs smoke around him. He fills the chinks with heath.
Loud roar two mountain streams which meet beside his booth.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Sad on the side of a hill the wandering shepherd sits. The tree resounds
above him. The stream roars down the rock. He waits for the rising moon
to guide him to his home.</p>

<p>Ghosts ride on the storm to-night. Sweet is their voice between the
squalls of wind. Their songs are of other worlds.</p>

<p>The rain is past. The dry wind blows. Streams roar, and windows flap.
Cold drops fall from the roof. I see the starry sky. But the shower
gathers again. The west is gloomy and dark. Night is stormy and dismal;
receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">THIRD BARD.</p>

<p>The wind still sounds between the hills, and whistles through the grass
of the rock. The firs fall from their place. The turfy hut is torn. The
clouds, divided, fly over the sky, and show the burning stars. The
meteor, token of death! flies sparkling through the gloom. It rests on
the hill. I see the withered fern, the dark-browed rock, the fallen oak.
Who is that in his shroud beneath the tree, by the stream?</p>

<p>The waves dark-tumble on the lake, and lash its rocky sides. The boat is
brimful in the cove; the oars on the rocking tide. A maid sits sad
beside the rock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> and eyes the rolling stream. Her lover promised to
come. She saw his boat, when yet it was light, on the lake. Is this his
broken boat on the shore? Are these his groans on the wind?</p>

<p>Hark! the hail rattles around. The flaky snow descends. The tops of the
hills are white. The stormy winds abate. Various is the night and cold;
receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">FOURTH BARD.</p>

<p>Night is calm and fair; blue, starry, settled is night. The winds, with
the clouds, are gone. They sink behind the hill. The moon is up on the
mountain. Trees glister, streams shine on the rock. Bright rolls the
settled lake; bright the stream of the vale.</p>

<p>I see the trees overturned; the shocks of corn on the plain. The wakeful
hind rebuilds the shocks, and whistles on the distant field.</p>

<p>Calm, settled, fair is night! Who comes from the place of the dead? That
form with the robe of snow, white arms, and dark-brown hair! It is the
daughter of the chief of the people: she that lately fell! Come, let us
view thee, O maid! Thou that hast been the delight of heroes! The blast
drives the phantom away; white, without form, it ascends the hill.</p>

<p>The breezes drive the blue mist, slowly, over the narrow vale. It rises
on the hill, and joins its head to heaven. Night is settled, calm, blue,
starry, bright with the moon. Receive me not, my friends, for lovely is
the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">FIFTH BARD.</p>

<p>Night is calm, but dreary. The moon is in a cloud in the west. Slow
moves that pale beam along the shaded hill. The distant wave is heard.
The torrent murmurs on the rock. The cock is heard from the booth.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
More than half the night is past. The house-wife, groping in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> the gloom,
re-kindles the settled fire. The hunter thinks that day approaches, and
calls his bounding dogs. He ascends the hill, and whistles on his way. A
blast removes the cloud. He sees the starry plough of the north. Much of
the night is to pass. He nods by the mossy rock.</p>

<p>Hark! the whirlwind is in the wood! A low murmur in the vale! It is the
mighty army of the dead returning from the air.</p>

<p>The moon rests behind the hill. The beam is still on that lofty rock.
Long are the shadows of the trees. Now it is dark over all. Night is
dreary, silent, and dark; receive me, my friends, from night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">THE CHIEF.</p>

<p>Let clouds rest on the hills: spirits fly, and travellers fear. Let the
winds of the woods arise, the sounding storms descend. Roar streams and
windows flap, and green-winged meteors fly! Rise the pale moon from
behind her hills, or inclose her head in clouds! Night is alike to me,
blue, stormy, or gloomy the sky. Night flies before the beam, when it is
poured on the hill. The young day returns from his clouds, but we return
no more.</p>

<p>Where are our chiefs of old? Where are our kings of mighty name? The
fields of their battles are silent. Scarce their mossy tombs remain. We
shall also be forgot. This lofty house shall fall. Our sons shall not
behold the ruins in grass. They shall ask of the aged, “Where stood the
walls of our fathers?”</p>

<p>Raise the song, and strike the harp; send round the shells of joy.
Suspend a hundred tapers on high. Youths and maids begin the dance. Let
some grey bard be near me, to tell the deeds of other times; of kings
renowned in our land, of chiefs we behold no more. Thus let the night
pass until morning shall appear in our halls. Then let the bow be at
hand, the dogs, the youths of the chase. We shall ascend the hill with
day, and awake the deer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p>The chase is over. No noise on Ardven but the torrent’s roar! Daughter
of Morni, come from Crona’s banks. Lay down the bow and take the harp.
Let the night come on with songs, let our joy be great on Ardven.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">MELILCOMA.</p>

<p>Night comes apace, thou blue-eyed maid! Grey night grows dim along the
plain. I saw a deer at Crona’s stream; a mossy bank he seemed through
the gloom, but soon he bounded away. A meteor played round his branching
horns! The awful faces of other times looked from the clouds of Crona!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">DERSAGRENA.</p>

<p>These are the signs of Fingal’s death. The king of shields is fallen!
and Caracul prevails. Rise, Comala, from thy rock: daughter of Sarno,
rise in tears! The youth of thy love is low; his ghost is on our hills.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">MELILCOMA.</p>

<p>There Comala sits forlorn! two grey dogs near shake their rough ears,
and catch the flying breeze. Her red cheek rests upon her arm, the
mountain-wind is in her hair. She turns her blue eyes toward the fields
of his promise. Where art thou, O Fingal? The night is gathering around!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>O Carun of the streams! Why do I behold thy waters rolling in blood? Has
the noise of the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> been heard; and sleeps the King of Morven?
Rise, moon, thou daughter of the sky! Look from between thy clouds, rise
that I may behold the gleam of his steel, on the field of his promise.
Or rather let the meteor, that lights our fathers through the night,
come, with its red beam, to show me the way to my fallen hero. Who will
defend me from sorrow? Who from the love of Hydallan? Long shall Comala
look before she can behold Fingal in the midst of his host; bright as
the coming forth of the morning, in the cloud of an early shower.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">HYDALLAN.</p>

<p>Dwell, thou mist of gloomy Crona, dwell on the path of the king! Hide
his steps from mine eyes, let me remember my friend no more. The bands
of battle are scattered, no crowding tread is round the noise of his
steel. O Carun! roll thy streams of blood, the chief of the people is
low.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>Who fell on Carun’s sounding banks, son of the cloudy night? Was he
white as the snow of Ardven? Blooming as the bow of the shower? Was his
hair like the mist of the hill, soft and curling in the day of the sun?
Was he like the thunder of heaven in battle? Fleet as the roe of the
desert?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">HYDALLAN.</p>

<p>O that I might behold his love, fair leaning from her rock! Her red eye
dim in tears, her blushing cheek half hid in her locks! Blow, O gentle
breeze! Lift thou the heavy locks of the maid, that I may behold her
white arm, her lovely cheek in her grief.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>And is the son of Comhal fallen, chief of the mournful tale? The thunder
rolls on the hill! The lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> flies on wings of fire! They frighten
not Comala; for Fingal is low. Say, chief of the mournful tale, fell the
breaker of the shields?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">HYDALLAN.</p>

<p>The nations are scattered on their hills; they shall hear the voice of
the king no more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>Confusion pursue thee over thy plains! Ruin overtake thee, thou king of
the world! Few be thy steps to thy grave; and let one virgin mourn thee!
Let her be like Comala, tearful in the days of her youth! Why hast thou
told me, Hydallan, that my hero fell? I might have hoped a little while
his return, I might have thought I saw him on the distant rock; a tree
might have deceived me with his appearance; the wind of the hill might
have been the sound of his horn in mine ear. O that I were on the banks
of Carun! that my tears might be warm on his cheek!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">HYDALLAN.</p>

<p>He lies not on the banks of Carun; on Ardven heroes raise his tomb. Look
on them, O moon! from thy clouds; be thy beam bright on his breast, that
Comala may behold him in the light of his armour!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>Stop, ye sons of the grave, till I behold my love! He left me at the
chase alone. I knew not that he went to war. He said he would return
with the night; the King of Morven is returned! Why didst thou not tell
me that he would fall, O trembling dweller of the rock? Thou sawest him
in the blood of his youth; but thou didst not tell Comala!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">MELILCOMA.</p>

<p>What sound is that on Ardven? Who is that, bright in the vale? Who comes
like the strength of rivers, when their crowded waters glitter to the
moon?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">COMALA.</p>

<p>Who is it but the foe of Comala, the son of the king of the world? Ghost
of Fingal! Do thou from thy cloud direct Comala’s bow. Let him fall like
the hart of the desert. It is Fingal in the crowd of his ghosts. Why
dost thou come, my love, to frighten and please my soul?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="nind">FINGAL.</p>

<p>Raise, ye bards, the song; raise the wars of the streamy Carun! Caracul
has fled from our arms along the fields of his pride. He sets far
distant like a meteor, that incloses a spirit of night, when the winds
drive it over the heath, and the dark woods are gleaming around. I heard
a voice, or was it the breeze of my hills? Is it the huntress of Ardven,
the white-handed daughter of Sarno? Look from thy rocks, my love; let me
hear the voice of Comala!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

seek thee on the heath but they shall not find thee. Thou shalt come, at

<h3>The Death-Song of Ossian.</h3>

<p>Such were the words of the bards in the days of song; when the king
heard the music of harps, the tales of other times! The chiefs gathered
from all their hills, and heard the lovely sound. They praised the Voice
of Cona! The first among a thousand bards! But age is now on my tongue;
my soul has failed! I hear, at times, the ghosts of the bards, and learn
their pleasant song. But memory fails on my mind. I hear the call of
years! They say, as they pass along, why does Ossian sing? Soon shall he
lie in the narrow house, and no bard shall raise his fame! Roll on, ye
dark-brown years; ye bring no joy on your course! Let the tomb open to
Ossian, for his strength has failed. The sons of song are gone to rest.
My voice remains, like a blast, that roars, lonely, on a sea-surrounded
rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moss whistles there; the
distant mariner sees the waving trees!</p>

<span class="i0">Every sail she bore aloft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The whole sea was lashing, dashing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fury and the surging of the water,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With piteous wailing and complaining<br /></span>
<span class="i6">All the storm-tossed horde,<br /></span>

<span class="i6">By the tumult of the ocean;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sea, like a great mess of pottage,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Troubled, muddy grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the blood of many mangled creatures,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With the claws and with the tails of monsters,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Pawing, squalling.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was frightful even to hear them<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Stepping proudly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our whole crew grew dull of hearing<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In the tempest’s scowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sharp the quavering cries of demons<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the wild beasts’ howl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the oaken planks the weltering waves were wrestling<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In their noisy splashing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the sharp beak of our swift ship<br /></span>
<span class="i6">On the sea-pigs came dashing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind kept still renewing all its wildness<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In the far West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with every kind of strain and trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i6">We were sore distress’d.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We were blinded with the water<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Showering o’er us ever;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the awful night like thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the lightning ceasing never.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bright fireballs in our tackling<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Flamed and smoked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the smell of burning brimstone<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a stay but we had started,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nails and couplings, twisted, broken.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Feeshie, fashie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the thwarts and all the gunwale<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all above and all below,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">How sore they had been press’d.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a bracket, not a rib,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But the storm had loosed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fore and aft from stem to stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">All had got confused.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a tiller but was split,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And the helm was wounded;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every board its own complaint<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Sadly sounded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every trennel, every fastening<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Had been giving way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a board remain’d as firm<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As at the break of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a bolt in her but started,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Not a rope the wind that bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a part of the whole vessel<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But was weaker than before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea spoke to us its peace prattle<br /></span>
<span class="i6">At the cross of Islay’s Kyle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rough wind, bitter boaster!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Was restrained for one good while.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest rose from off us into places<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Lofty in the upper air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after all its noisy barking<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ruffled round us fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we gave thanks to the High King,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Who rein’d the wind’s rude breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saved our good Clan Ranald<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From a bad and brutal death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we furl’d up the fine and speckled sails<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of linen wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we took down the smooth red dainty masts,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And laid them by the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On our long and slender polish’d oars<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They were all made of the fir cut by Mac Barais<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In Eilean Fionain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We went with our smooth, dashing rowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And steady shock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we reach’d the good port round the point<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of Fergus’ Rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There casting anchor peacefully<br /></span>
<span class="i6">We calmly rode;<br /></span>

<h3>The Return of Song.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">LORD DUNSANY</div>

<p>“The swans are singing again,” said to one another the gods. And looking
downwards, for my dreams had taken me to some fair and far Valhalla, I
saw below me an iridescent bubble not greatly larger than a star shine
beautifully but faintly, and up and up from it looking larger and larger
came a flock of white, innumerable swans, singing and singing and
singing, till it seemed as though even the gods were wild ships swimming
in music.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I said to one that was humble among the gods.</p>

<p>“Only a world has ended,” he said to me, “and the swans are coming back
to the gods returning the gift of song.”</p>

<p>“A whole world dead!” I said.</p>

<p>“Dead,” said he that was humble among the gods. “The worlds are not for
ever; only song is immortal.”</p>

<p>“Look! look!” he said. “There will be a new one soon.”</p>

<p>And I looked and saw the larks, going down from the gods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_393" id="page_393">{393}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind2">THE MYSTERY OF AMERGIN.<br /><a href="#page_3">PAGE 3</a></p>

<p>Of this strange pantheistical fragment, Dr Douglas Hyde writes:&mdash;“The
first poem written in Ireland is said to have been the work of Amergin,
who was brother of Evir, Ir, and Eremon, the first Milesian princes who
colonised Ireland many hundred of years before Christ. The three short
pieces of verse ascribed to Amergin are certainly very ancient and very
strange. But, as the whole story of the Milesian invasion is wrapped in
mystery and is quite possibly only a rationalised account of early Irish
mythology (in which the Tuatha De Danann, Firbolgs, and possibly
Milesians, are nothing but the gods of the early Irish euhemerised into
men), no faith can be placed in the alleged date or genuineness of
Amergin’s verses. They are, however, of interest, because as Irish
tradition has always represented them as being the first verses made in
Ireland, so it may very well be that they actually do present the oldest
surviving lines in any vernacular tongue in Europe except Greek.”</p>

<p>This striking poem is given as translated by Professor Kuno Meyer. It
and other verses are to be found, in the original, in <i>The Book of
Lismore</i> (15th century). The particular narrative therein deals with the
visit of Laegaire mac Crimthainn to the land of Faerie. The episodic
portion of this narrative has been translated and edited by Mr Standish
Hayes O’Grady (see <i>Silva Gadelica</i>); but the general reader may be more
interested in the brief and lucid commentary of Professor Kuno Meyer
(see <i>The Voyage of Bran</i>&mdash;with Essay on the Celtic Elysium, by Mr
Alfred Nutt&mdash;recently published by D. Nutt). Professor Meyer considers
this and the other verses of “Laegaire mac Crimthainn” to be as old as
the 10th century period. “The Faerie Host,” as here given, is
fragmentary, being part of an episode; but I have further curtailed it
by three lines, for the sake of effect and unity of impression. The
other three lines are&mdash;</p>

VISION OF A FAIR WOMAN.<br /><a href="#page_13">PAGE 13</a></p>

<p>This characteristic Scoto-Celtic poem is supposed by some scholars to be
very ancient. The Gaelic version permits of some doubt on the
conjecture, but the text is not in this instance conclusive. The
“Aisling” will be found in Smith’s <i>Collection of Ancient Poems, from
the Gaelic of Ossian, Ullin, Orran, and others</i> (1780)&mdash;the reputed
originals of which were published in 1787. See, for easier reference,

<h3>EARLY CYMRIC</h3>

<p class="nind2">THE SOUL.<br /><a href="#page_67">PAGE 67</a></p>

<p>This strange fragment is of unknown antiquity, and may well be, as
affirmed, of as remote a date as the 6th or even 5th century. It is from
that remarkable depository of early Cymric lore, <i>The Black Book of
Caermarthen</i> (1154-1189).</p>

<p class="nind2">LLYWARC’H HEN.<br /><a href="#page_68">PAGE 68</a></p>

<p>The “Gorwynion” of Llywarc’h Hên, “Prince of the Cambrian Britons” (if
it is really the work of that poet), is one of the most famous
productions of early Cymric literature. Llywarc’h Hên’s <i>floreat</i> is by
some authorities placed in the middle of the 7th century, by others so
early as the beginning of the 6th, and by others as really extending
from early in the 6th till the middle of the 7th: the drift of evidence
indicates the remoter date as the more probable. The translation here
given was made about a hundred years ago by William Owen. It is not easy
to find an English equivalent for “Gorwynion,” a plural word which
signifies objects that have a very bright whiteness or glare. Perhaps
the word glitterings might serve, though, as has been suggested, the
nearest term would be <i>Coruscants</i>. The last line of these verses
generally contains some moral maxim, unconnected with the preceding
lines, except in the metre. It is said that the custom arose through the
desire of the bards to assist the memory in the conveyance of
instruction by oral means. In the translation the rhymed or assonantal
unity of the tercets is lost, with the result that the third-line maxim
generally comes in with almost ludicrous inappositeness. According to
the <i>Triads of the Isle of Britain</i>, Llywarc’h Hên passed his younger
days at the Court of Arthur. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_408" id="page_408">{408}</a></span> one triad he is alluded to as one of
the three free guests at the Arthurian Court; in another, as one of the
three counselling warriors. According to tradition, the bones of this
princely bard lie beneath the Church of Llanvor, where, as averred, he
was interred at the patriarchal age of 150 years. He was not one of the
Sacred Bards, because of his military profession as a prince and knight;
for these might not carry arms, and in their presence a naked sword even
might not be held. The <i>Beirdd</i> were not poets and sages only, but were
accounted and accepted as missioners of peace.</p>

<p class="nind2">LLYWARC’H HEN.<br /><a href="#page_71">PAGE 71</a></p>

<p>This is another series of “Gorwynion,” attributed to Llywarc’h Hên by Mr
Skene, who has translated it from <i>The Red Book of Hergest</i> (MS.
compiled in 14th and 15th centuries). The English rendering of <i>The Red
Book</i> was issued through Messrs Edmonston &amp; Douglas of Edinburgh in
1868.</p>

<p class="nind2">TALIESIN.<br /><a href="#page_73">PAGE 73</a></p>

<p>“Song to the Wind” (<i>Vide</i> Introduction). “The Song about the Wind,” of
which only a section is given here, will be found in full in Skene’s
<i>Four Ancient Books of Wales</i>, Vol. I., page 535, and is the most famous
poem by the most famous of Cymric bards. It was first translated, some
forty-five years ago, by Lady Charlotte Guest, whose Englished
renderings of the “Mabinogion” attracted the attention of scholars
throughout the whole Western world. (Longmans, 1849 and later.) Emerson
delighted in the “Song,” and declared it to be one of the finest pieces
of its kind extant in any literature. See also the <i>Myvyrian
Archaiology</i>.</p>

<p class="nind2">ANEURIN.<br /><a href="#page_75">PAGE 75</a></p>

<p>Aneurin was one of the famous warrior bards of ancient Wales. His birth
is noted as <i>Circa</i> 500 <small>A.D.</small>, and in any case he flourished during the
first half of the 6th century. Aneurin&mdash;like Taliesin, called “the
monarch of the bards”&mdash;was a Briton of Manau Gododin, a principality or
province of Cymric Scotland, now Mid-Lothian and Linlithgowshire. Manau
Gododin stretched from the Carron of to-day (the Carun of Ossian), some
miles to the north-west of Falkirk to the river Esk, that now divides
Mid-Lothian and East Lothian. Manau Gododin was then much more Celtic
(Pictish) than Gododin. “Breatan Cymru” (<i>i.e.</i> the country of the Welsh
Britons) then comprised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_409" id="page_409">{409}</a></span> larger part of southern Scotland&mdash;that is,
from the north end of Loch Lomond, and from the upper reaches of the
Gwruid (the Forth), to the Mull of Galloway on the south-west; eastward
to a line drawn from the western Lammermuirs, by Melrose, Kelso, and
Jedburgh, and so down by the Cheviots to Hexham, and thence
southwesterly by Cumberland. The exception was the Pictish or Celtic
province of Galloway&mdash;bounded on the west by Carrawg (that part of
Ayrshire known as Carrick); on the north by Coel (Kyle); on the east by
a line drawn from Sanquhar through Nithsdale and by Dumfries to
Locharmoss and the Solway; on the south-west, by Novant (Mull of
Galloway); and on the south by the Solway Firth.</p>

<p>Aneurin was a contemporary of the princely poet, Llywarc’h Hên. He was
called Aneurin y Coed Awr ap Caw o Gwm Cawlwyd&mdash;or, again, Aneurin
Gwadrydd&mdash;both designations indicative of his greatness. It has been
maintained that Aneurin is identical with the celebrated Gildas, “the
author of the Latin epistle which Bede so blindly copied,” both Aneurin
and Gildas having been sons of Caw. He is supposed to be alluded to as
the seventh bard, in a curious fragment preserved in the <i>Myvyrian
Archaiology</i> (Vol. III.), which I excerpt here.</p>

<p>“The seven questions put by Catwg the Wise, to the Seven Wise Men of the
College of Llanvuthan, and the answers of these men:</p>

<p class="hang">1. “What is the greatest wisdom of man?” “To be able to do evil and
not to do it,” answered <i>St Tedio</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">2. “What is the highest goodness of man?” “Justice,” answered
<i>Tahaiarn</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">3. “What is the worst principle of man?” “Falsehood,” answered
<i>Taliesin</i>, chief of Bards.</p>

<p class="hang">4. “What is the noblest action of man?” “Correctness,” answered
<i>Cynan</i>, son of Clydno Eddin.</p>

<p class="hang">5. “What is the greatest folly of man?” “To desire a common evil,
which he cannot do,” answered <i>Ystyvan</i>, the Bard of Teilo.</p>

<p class="hang">6. “Who is the poorest man?” “He who is not contented with his own
property,” answered <i>Arawn</i>, son of Cynvarch.</p>

<p class="hang">7. “Who is the richest man?” “He who does not covet anything
belonging to others,” answered <i>Gildas</i> of Coed Awr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_410" id="page_410">{410}</a></span></p>

<p>“The Ode to the Months” is given in the translation of William Probert
(1820), according to whom the Ode contains moral maxims and observations
which were known and repeated long before Aneurin lived, and were put
into verse by him as an aid to the memory: “valuable, because they show
the modes of thinking and expression which the primitive inhabitants of
Britain used nearly 2000 years ago.”</p>

<p class="nind2">DAFYDD AP GWILYM.<br /><a href="#page_78">PAGE 78</a></p>

<p>(Fl. 14th century.) In his love of Nature, and in the richness of his
poetic imagination (as well, so say those who can read Welsh fluently,
as in his poetry), Dafydd ap Gwilym is the Keats of Wales. The romance
of his life and wild-wood experiences has yet to be written: and we
still await an adequate translator&mdash;though, to judge from some recent
renderings by Mr Ernest Rhys, in an interesting short study of Dafydd,
recently published in <i>The Chap Book</i> (Stone &amp; Kimball, Chicago) we may
not have to wait much longer. He was a love-child: of noble parentage,
though born under a hedge at Llandaff. His mother wedded after his
birth; but he remained the “wilding” throughout his life. He became the
favourite of Ivor Hael of Emlyn, with whose daughter Morvydd he fell in
love. He wooed and won her “under the greenwood tree,” but only to lose
her shortly afterward, when she was forcibly married to a man called Bwa
Bach. Dafydd stole her from her legitimate husband, but was captured and
imprisoned. His ultimate release was due to the payment of the imposed
fine, the sum having been got together by the men of Glamorgan. His most
ardent love-poetry is addressed to this fair Morvydd.</p>

<p class="nind2">RHYS GOCH OF ERYRI.<br /><a href="#page_82">PAGE 82</a></p>

<p>There are two famous poets of the name of Rhys Goch; probably both
belong to the 14th century (and Wilkins certainly disputes the claim of
Rhys Goch ap Rhiccart to be of the 12th century). This Ode is an
illustration of the sound answering the sense. Rhys was in love with the
fair Gwen of Dol, and sent a peacock to her. His rival, also a bard,
composed a poem to the Fox, beseeching it to kill his rival’s present,
and, singularly enough, the bird was destroyed by a fox, and the rival
bard was happy. Stung by this misadventure, Rhys composed the above,
which, in the original, so teems with gutturals that Sion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_411" id="page_411">{411}</a></span> Tudor called
it the “Shibboleth of Sobriety, because no man, when drunk, could
possibly pronounce it.”</p>

</p>

<p>From <i>Homeward Songs by the Way</i> (Whaley, Dublin).</p>

<p>This little book, published in paper covers, and apparently with every
effort to avoid rather than court publicity, almost immediately
attracted the notice of the few who watch contemporary poetry with
scrupulously close attention. The author, who is well known in Dublin
literary society, prefers to disguise his identity in public under the
initials A.E., though it is no longer a secret that Mr G. W. Russell is
the name of this poet-dreamer, who, like Blake, of whom he is a student
and interpreter, has also a faculty of pictorial expression of a rare
and distinctive kind.</p>

<p class="nind2">
WM. ALLINGHAM. (1824-1889.)      <a href="#page_92">PAGES 92-94</a><br />
</p>

<p>Every lover of Irish poetry is familiar with “The Fairies” of the late
William Allingham. He is an Irish rather than distinctively a Celtic
poet in the strict sense of the word; but every now and again he strikes
the genuine Celtic note, as in his well-known “Fairies,” and the little
poem called the “Æolian Harp,” by which he is also represented here.
Much the best critical summary of his life-work is to be found in the
brief memoir by Mr W. B. Yeats in Miles’ <i>Poets and Poetry of the
Century</i>, Vol. V., p. 209. Among the innumerable love songs of the Irish
peasantry there are few more beautiful than Allingham’s “Mary Donnelly.”
As Mr Yeats says, he was “the poet of little things and little moments,
and neither his emotions nor his thoughts took any wide sweep over the
world of Man and Nature.” His “Laurence Bloomfield” is already
practically forgotten; but many of the lighter and often exquisitely
deft lyrics of his early life will remain in the memory of the Irish
people, and one or two at least in English literature.</p>

<p class="nind2">
THOMAS BOYD.<br /><a href="#page_95">PAGE 95</a></p>

<p>So far as I know, Mr Thomas Boyd has not published any volume of verse.
Some of his poems have appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_412" id="page_412">{412}</a></span> <i>United Ireland</i>, among them the
beautiful lines, “To the Lianhaun Shee.”</p>

<p class="nind2">EMILY BRONTË. (1818-1848.)<br /><a href="#page_97">PAGE 97</a></p>

<p>It may be as well to explain to those readers who take it for granted
that Emily Brontë is to be accounted an English poet, that she was of
Irish nationality and birth. The name Brontë, so familiar now through
the genius of herself and her sister, was originally Prunty. Everything
from her pen has a note of singular distinction; but perhaps she could
hardly be more characteristically represented than by the poem called
“Remembrance.” The, in quantity, meagre poetic legacy of the author of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> is comprised (under her pseudonym, Ellis Bell) in
the volume <i>Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell</i>.</p>

<p class="nind2">
STOPFORD A. BROOKE.<br />      <a href="#page_98">PAGE 98-100</a><br />
</p>

<p>“The Earth and Man” and “Song” (from the poem called “Six Days”) are
from Mr Stopford Brooke’s volume, <i>Poems</i> (Macmillan &amp; Co.). These seem
to me fairly representative of the distinctive atmosphere which Mr
Brooke conveys in all his poetry. See particularly his <i>Riquet of The
Tuft</i> (1880) and <i>Poems</i> (1888).</p>

<p class="nind2">
JOHN K. CASEY.<br />      <a href="#page_101">PAGE 101-3</a><br />
</p>

<p>Most of Mr Casey’s poems appeared above the signature “Leo.” Born in
1846, the son of a peasant, his early efforts to make literature his
profession were handicapped by inevitable disadvantages. In 1876 he was
arrested as a Fenian conspirator, and imprisoned. This, combined with
the influence of his unselfish patriotism and the popularity of many of
his lyrics, gave him a recognised place in the Irish Brotherhood of
Song.</p>

<p>
GEORGE DARLEY. (1795-1846.)<br /><a href="#page_104">PAGE 104</a></p>

<p>This remarkable poet, who has so strangely lapsed from public
remembrance, was in his own day greatly admired by his fellow-poets and
the most discerning critics of the period. Mrs Browning, and Robert
Browning still more, were deeply impressed by what is now his best known
production&mdash;<i>Sylvia: a Lyrical Drama</i> (1836); and Alfred Tennyson was so
struck by the quality of the young poet’s work that he volunteered to
defray the cost of publishing his verse. Lord Tennyson frequently, in
conversation, alluded to George Darley as one of the “hopelessly
misapprehended men”; and we have Robert Browning’s own authority, says
Darley’s latest biographer, Mr John<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_413" id="page_413">{413}</a></span> H. Ingram, for stating that
<i>Sylvia</i> did much to determine the form of his own early dramas.
<i>Sylvia</i>, again, charmed Coleridge; and in 1836, Miss Mitford, whom Mr
Ingram calls a leading spirit among the <i>literati</i> of her day,
writes:&mdash;“I have just had a present of a most exquisite poem, which old
Mr Carey (the translator of Dante and Pindar) thinks more highly of than
any poem of the present day&mdash;‘Sylvia, or The May Queen,’ by George
Darley. It is exquisite&mdash;something between the ‘Faithful Shepherdess’
and the ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Darley was the eldest child of Arthur Darley, of the Scalp, County
Wicklow. The poet, however, was not born there, but in Dublin, in the
year 1795. While he was a child, his parents emigrated to the United
States; and the boy spent the first ten years of his life at the family
home in Wicklow. In due time, and subsequent to the return of his
parents from America, he went through the usual scholastic routine,
though he did not graduate at Trinity College, Dublin, till his
twenty-fifth year&mdash;a delay in great part due to what, then and later, he
considered a disastrous impediment of speech. From the loss of a
scholarship to the social deprivations he underwent in London, this
infirmity, he declared, was his evil fortune. His first book, <i>The
Errors of Ecstasie</i>, was published (1822) in London, where he had
settled. Needless to say, as this volume consists mainly of a dialogue
between a Mystic and the Moon, the reading public remained in absolute
ignorance of the new poet. His second book (1826) consisted of a series
of prose tales and verses, collectively entitled&mdash;<i>The Labours of
Idleness; or, Seven Nights’ Entertainments</i>&mdash;set forth as by “Guy
Penseval.” Three years later appeared his chief work, <i>Sylvia</i>.
Notwithstanding its divers shortcomings, some of them frankly
acknowledged by the author himself, <i>Sylvia</i> is a creation of genuine
imagination, and possesses a haunting and quite distinctive charm. Both
the merits and demerits of his too often uncontrolled style are
adequately indicated in the criticism of Mr Ingram: “[frequently] his
wild Celtic fancy breaks its curb and carries him into clouds of
metaphor as marvellous as they are musical, although often the flight
ends by a hasty and undignified descent to commonplace earth.” There is
no commonplace, however, in his exquisite faëry verse, which, in the
words of the same critic, “is among<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_414" id="page_414">{414}</a></span> the loveliest in the language; at
times is even sweeter than Drayton’s, and is as fantastic as
Shakespeare’s own.”</p>

<p>For ten years the poet kept silence; but in 1839 he issued his
fragmentary and extraordinary <i>Nepenthe</i>&mdash;a poem which, with all its
brilliant quality and daring richness of imagery, might well be taken as
an example of the Celtic genius <i>in extremis</i>&mdash;so unreservedly does he
give way to an uncontrolled imagination. Perhaps the best thing said
about <i>Nepenthe</i> is in a letter from the author himself, wherein he
writes:&mdash;“Does it not speak a heat of brain mentally Bacchic?”</p>

<p>Nothing that Darley published afterwards enhanced his reputation. Lovers
of his best work, however, should read the posthumous volume of his
“Poems” edited by R. and M. J. Livingstone&mdash;a rare volume, as it was
printed for private circulation. It contains some of the songs from an
unpublished lyrical drama called <i>The Sea Bride</i>; and it is from this
that the “Dirge,” quoted at page 104 in this book, comes. In this
posthumous collection also is included the following striking and
characteristic lyric:&mdash;</p>

<p class="c">THE FALLEN STAR.</p>

<p>After a life of great intellectual activity, but of singular isolation
and of misanthropic unhappiness, George Darley died in London on the
23rd of November 1846, in his fifty-first year. For further information
as to the personality and writings of this strange, undeservedly
neglected, but unbalanced man of genius, the reader may be referred to

</p>

<p>Mr Aubrey De Vere is one of the most scholarly poets of Ireland. All his
work is informed with a high and serious spirit; and though the bulk of
it is not distinctively Celtic, either in sentiment or utterance, not
even distinctively Irish, he has written some poems which are as dear to
Nationalists and Celticists as is almost any other verse by contemporary
poets. Mr Aubrey De Vere is the younger brother of Sir Stephen De Vere,
Bart. (the translator of Horace, and himself a poet of distinction), and
son of Aubrey De Vere, the poet friend of Wordsworth. He was born in
1814, and has lived most of his life, with long intervals in London and
in several parts of Europe, at his birthplace, Curragh Chase, Adare, Co.
Limerick. Among his most noteworthy writings are:&mdash;<i>The Waldensees</i>
(1842); <i>The Search after Proserpine</i> (1843); <i>Poems</i> (1853); <i>The
Sisters</i> (1861); <i>The Infant Bridal: and other Poems</i> (1864); <i>Irish
Odes</i> (1869); <i>The Legends of St Patrick</i> (1872); <i>Alexander the Great</i>,
a poetical drama (1874); and another drama, <i>St Thomas of Canterbury</i>
(1876); <i>Antar and Zara: and other Poems</i> (1877); <i>Legends of the Saxon
Saints</i> (1879); and <i>The Foray of Queen Meave</i>, based upon an ancient
Irish epic (1882). Since then Mr Aubrey De Vere has published a
Selection of his poems and one or two books of a religious nature. His
best prose work is to be found in his <i>Essays chiefly on Poetry</i> (1887),
and <i>Essays chiefly Literary and Ethical</i> (1889).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_416" id="page_416">{416}</a></span></p>

<p>Author of <i>Irish Songs and Poems</i>, published under the pseudonym
“Dreolin.” Mr Fahy is a member of the group of notable lyrists whose
captain is Sir Samuel Ferguson.</p>

<p class="nind2">SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON. (1810-1886.)<br /><a href="#page_109">PAGE 109</a></p>

<p>This celebrated poet and archæologist was born in Belfast. He has aptly
been called a man of encyclopædic learning; but this learning did not
prevent his becoming perhaps the foremost Irish poet of the Middle
Victorian period. His most ambitious poetic work is <i>Congal: an Epic
Poem</i> (1872)&mdash;a work full of lofty imagination and epical music, but
unfortunate in its metrical setting. His short poem, “The Forging of the
Anchor,” is one of the most celebrated and popular poems of our era.
Even yet, the influence of his <i>Lays of the Western Gael</i> (1865) is
considerable, and for good. “Cean Dubh Deelish” (darling dark head), of
which several able, and one or two good translations have been made,
finds its happiest interpreter in Ferguson. How many poets and lovers
have repeated these lines&mdash;</p>

ALFRED PERCIVAL GRAVES.<br /><a href="#page_113">PAGE 113</a></p>

<p>One of the best known names of Ireland of to-day. Mr Graves, born in
Dublin in 1846, is thoroughly national, and his delightful work is
perhaps as adequately typical of the Irish spirit as that of any one man
could be. His lyric faculty&mdash;or at any rate his movement, his verve&mdash;is
unsurpassed by any living Irishman. These few examples of his poetical
writings should win him many more readers. His first book, <i>Songs of
Killarney</i>, was published over twenty years ago. Since then he has
issued <i>Irish Songs and Ballads</i>, <i>Songs of Old Ireland</i>, and (1880) his
best known<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_417" id="page_417">{417}</a></span> collection, <i>Father O’Flynn: and other Irish Lyrics</i>. <i>Irish
Songs and Airs</i> is the title of his promised contribution to Sir Gavan
Duffy’s Irish Library.</p>

<p>The author of the lovely song, “Eileen Aroon” (Nellie, my Darling), was
born in Limerick. His chief work is his novel, <i>The Collegians</i>, which
has been pronounced to be “the most perfect Irish novel published.” I
have heard that Tennyson once “went mooning about for days,” repeating
with endless gusto, and with frequent expressions of a wish that he was
the author of, the closing lines:&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>This young Irish poet made an immediate impression by her <i>Ballads in
Prose</i> (John Lane). Both in prose and verse she displays the true Celtic
note, and often the unmistakable Celtic intensity. The lovely lyrics
“April in Ireland,” and “The Wind among the Reeds,” are from <i>Ballads in
Prose</i>. “The Dark Man” has not hitherto appeared in print, and I am
indebted to Miss Hopper for her permission to quote it here. It is, I
understand, to be included in her shortly forthcoming volume, to be
published by Mr John Lane.</p>

<p class="nind2">
DOUGLAS HYDE, LL.D.<br /><a href="#page_126">PAGE 126</a></p>

<p>Dr Hyde, one of the foremost living expositors of Gaelic folklore in
Ireland, was born about thirty-five years ago in the Co. Roscommon,
where he has since resided. He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin,
after an exceptionally brilliant University career. He is now President
of the Gaelic League, and one of the acknowledged leaders of the Gaelic
wing of the Celtic Renascence; but from the first he was in the front
rank of those who are working for the preservation of the ancient Irish
language and the rescue of its beautiful fugitive literature. Although
best known by his Irish Tales, taken down at first hand from the
peasantry, and other Folk-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_418" id="page_418">{418}</a></span>collections, and his invaluable and unique
<i>The Love Songs of Connacht</i> (Connaught), he is himself a poet of mark.
(See, also, Note XI., <i>supra</i>.) Those who are in a position to judge
declare his Gaelic poetry, which appears in the Irish Press above the
signature “An Chraoibhin Aoibhinn,” to be of altogether exceptional
excellence. The work Dr Douglas Hyde does deserves the most cordial
recognition. No man has worked more whole-heartedly, more
enthusiastically, and with more far-reaching success for the cause of
the Irish-Gaelic language, folk-lore, and literature, and, it may be
added, the best interests of the Irish of the soil.</p>

<p>The songs by which he is represented in this volume are from the <i>Love
Songs of Connacht</i> (Fisher Unwin, 1893), a book which is not only
indispensable to the Celtic scholar, but should be in the hands of every
lover of Celtic literature, old-time or new. All are translations,
though perhaps paraphrastic rather than metaphrastic. Both in their
music and in their intensity&mdash;in, also, their peculiar lyric lilt&mdash;they
are distinctively West Irish. The collection from which these poems are
drawn was issued as <i>The Fourth Chapter of the Songs of Connacht</i>. The
preceding three appeared in the now defunct <i>Nation</i>. They were all
originally written in Irish; but very wisely, or at any rate for us very
fortunately, Dr Hyde interpolated translations. In these he has
endeavoured to reproduce the vowel-rhymes as well as the exact metres of
the original poems. We must hope to see the reprint, in like fashion, of
the predecessors of this volume.</p>

<p class="nind2">LIONEL JOHNSON.<br /><a href="#page_133">PAGE 133</a></p>

<p>Though come of a Dublin family, and otherwise Irish by descent, Mr
Johnson was born at Broadstairs in Kent (1867). He first became known to
the reading public, as a poet, by his contributions to <i>The Book of the
Rhymers’ Club</i>, notable for their distinction of touch. Since then Mr
Johnson has published much in prose and verse, though in book form he
has not, I think, produced any other prose work than his admirable study
of Thomas Hardy, or any other volume of poetry than his <i>Poems</i>. His
work is not characterised by distinctively Celtic quality, though
occasionally, as in “The Red Wind” and “To Morfydd,” the Celtic note
makes itself audible. No doubt&mdash;to judge from internal evidence in his
later writings&mdash;Mr Johnson’s poetic work, at least, will develop more
and more along the line of his racial bent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_419" id="page_419">{419}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind2">DENIS FLORENCE MACCARTHY. (1817-1882.)<br /><a href="#page_135">PAGE 135</a></p>

<p>Mr Maccarthy, who was a barrister in Dublin, and one of the main
supports of the <i>Nation</i>, is best known by his fine translations of
Calderon’s Dramas. The “Lament,” by which he is here represented, has
always seemed to me his most haunting lyrical achievement. It is
necessary to add, however, that this poem is somewhat condensed from the
original&mdash;which is weakened by diffuseness. The score or so of lines
beginning “As fire-flies fade,” have been favourites with many poets of
Maccarthy’s own time and later.</p>

<p class="nind2">JAMES CLARENCE MANGAN. (1803-1849.)<br /><a href="#page_137">PAGE 137</a></p>

<p>While it is not the case, as sometimes averred, that Mangan was, or is,
to Ireland what Burns is to Scotland, it is indisputable that the claim
may be made for him rather than for any other Irish poet of the Early
Victorian period. In fire and energy his faculty is unsurpassed by any
of his poetic countrymen, though we may dispute Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy’s assertion that Mangan “has not, and perhaps never had, any rival
in mastery of the metrical and rhythmical resources of the English
tongue.” Mangan was the child of a small tradesman of Dublin, where, in
1803, he was born. From childhood, fate dealt hardly with him. Abandoned
in his early boyhood, he was indebted to a relative for his education;
but when, in his fifteenth year, he became a copyist in a lawyer’s
office, at a small pittance, his kindred discovered him and compelled
him to share his meagre gains with them. For ten years thereafter he
toiled in this bitter bondage. In his own words:&mdash;“I was obliged to work
seven years of the ten from five in the morning, winter and summer, to
eleven at night; and during the three remaining years, nothing but a
special Providence could have saved me from suicide.” No wonder that,
from an early period in his life, he found relief from his misery in
drink; but it was misery and unbroken ill-fortune and adversity, much
more than the curse of his fatal habit, that really killed him. There is
a period in his life which is a blank, “a blank into which he entered a
bright-haired youth and emerged a withered and stricken man.” His first
chance for a happier life came with his appointment to a minor post in
the University Library of Dublin, and it was during this time that most
of his best work was done. His highest level is reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_420" id="page_420">{420}</a></span> in his
brilliant free paraphrases of German originals: <i>Anthologia Germania</i>
(1845). His later years were darkened by the worst phases of his malady,
and he died (as in most part he had lived, in misery and poverty) in
Meath Hospital, in his forty-seventh year. He has written one lyric that
Irishmen will always account immortal: “Dark Rosaleen”&mdash;a wild and
passionate rhapsody on Ireland herself. “Dark Rosaleen,” “Silk of the
Kine,” “The Little Black Rose,” “Kathleen Ny Houlahan”&mdash;these were at
one time the familiar analogues of Ireland. Of his Oriental paraphrases
the most stirring is “The Karamanian Exile.” Strangely enough, Mangan’s
Irish renderings are less happy than those poems which he based upon
German and Oriental originals; but sometimes, as in the beautiful “Fair
Hills of Eiré, O!” after the Irish of Donough mac Con-Mara, he has
bequeathed a memorable lyric. Of poems that are strictly original,
nothing seems to me more characteristic of Mangan than “The One Mystery”
(see p. 142).</p>

<p class="nind2">ROSA MULHOLLAND.<br /><a href="#page_144">PAGE 144</a></p>

<p>This accomplished prose-writer and poet was born in Belfast. Since her
<i>Vagrant Verses</i> (1886) she has published many stories and poems, and is
a regular contributor to the leading Irish periodicals. Her “Fionnula”
is one of the happiest renderings of the legend of the Swan Daughters of
Lir; but is too long for quotation in the text. “The Wild Geese,” by
which she is represented here, is eminently characteristic. Her latest
poem, and one of her best, appears under the title “Under a Purple
Cloud” in the autumn number of <i>The Evergreen</i>. It is a vision of Earth
personified, and opens thus:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">

A dark cheek on her hand, and in her eyes<br />

Her mighty head is coifed in filmy gold,<br />
Her youngest babe, the newly-blossomed rose<br />

<p class="nind2">THE HON. RODEN NOËL. (1834-1894.)<br /><a href="#page_146">PAGE 146</a></p>

<p>Mr Roden Noël was son of the first Earl of Gainsborough, grandson of
Lord Roden of Tullymore in Ireland, and nephew to the present Marquis of
Londonderry. By birth, descent, training, and sympathy, he considered
himself an Irishman: though he was half English by blood, and lived the
greater part of his life in England, while his intellectual homage was
largely evoked by Hellenic mythology and lore, and by Teutonic mysticism
and speculation. It was this confused blending of influences which,
perhaps, militated so strongly against the concentration of his
brilliant abilities into long-sustained and organic creative effort.
With all his shortcomings, he still remains a poet of genuine impulse
and occasionally of high distinction; and some of his lyrics and
ballads, of a more essentially human interest than his more ambitious
work, are likely to be held in honourable remembrance. The “Lament for a
Little Child” (see p. 146) has passed into literature; as, indeed, may
perhaps be said of the book whence it comes: <i>A Little Child’s Monument</i>
(1881). In one of his Cornish poems he begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">
“For me, true son of Erin, thou art rife,<br />
Grand coast of Cornwall, cliff, and cave, and surge,<br />
With glamour of the Kelt.”<br />
</div></div>

<p>I do not think there is much “glamour of the Kelt” in Roden Noël’s work,
but it may be discerned in one or two poems in each of his volumes, and
in many of his lyrics and irregular lyrical compositions there is much
of Celtic intensity and dream. Few poets have written of the sea with
more loving knowledge and profound sympathy; hence it is that he is
represented here by one characteristic sea-poem, called “The
Swimmer”&mdash;as autobiographical as anything of the kind can be. The
swimmer’s joy was Roden Noël’s chief physical delight. All who knew the
man himself remember him as one of the personalities of his time, and as
a man of individual distinction and charm. Besides the book already
mentioned, his chief poetic volumes are <i>Beatrice and Other Poems</i>
(1868); <i>Songs of the Heights and Deeps</i> (1885); and <i>A Modern Faust</i>
(1888). See also the Selection from his poems published in the
Canterbury Poets Series (edited, with a Critical Introduction, by Mr
Robert Buchanan), and the posthumous volumes <i>My Sea</i> and <i>Selected
Lyrics</i> (Elkin Mathews).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_422" id="page_422">{422}</a></span></p>

<p>
CHARLES P. O’CONOR.<br /><a href="#page_158">PAGE 158</a></p>

<p>Besides this typical Irish song, Mr O’Conor has written other winsome
lyrics of the same kind. One of the best is that called “Erinn”
beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>
“O, a lovely place is Erinn, in the summer of the year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Roseen dhu ma Erinn.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>This and “Maura Du of Ballyshannon” are from his <i>Songs of a Life</i>
(Kentish Mercury Office, 1875).</p>

<p>
JOHN FRANCIS O’DONNELL.<br /><a href="#page_160">PAGE 160</a></p>

<p>This pretty Spinning Song is characteristic of the always deft and
generally delicate and winsome lyrical writing of Mr Francis O’Donnell.</p>

<p class="nind2">JOHN BOYLE O’REILLY.<br /><a href="#page_161">PAGE 161</a></p>

<p>This prolific writer, often designated an Irish-American poet, through
the accident of his enforced exile to, and long residence in, the United
States, is inadequately represented by the brief lyric, “A White Rose”;
but it is significant of his best achievement, for he is always at his
happiest in brief, spontaneous lyrics, often in a Heinesque vein. John
Boyle O’Reilly was born at Dowth Castle in Ireland. In his early manhood
he enlisted in a hussar regiment; and it was while as a hussar that he
was arrested on the charge of spreading republican principles in the
ranks, and was sentenced to be shot. This sentence was commuted to
twenty years of penal servitude; when the unfortunate man, victim of
that disastrous as well as iniquitous tyranny which has characterised
the English official attitude towards the Celtic populations, was taken
to the convict settlements of Western Australia. Thence, in time, he
escaped, and after hairbreadth escapes reached Philadelphia. From there
he went to Boston, where he settled; and in a few years, by virtue of
his remarkable gifts as a poet, a prose-writer, and a brilliant
journalist, became an acknowledged power in trans-Atlantic literature. A
novel of his, <i>Moondyne</i>, is widely and deservedly celebrated. Of his
poetical works, the best are <i>Songs of the Southern Seas</i>, <i>Songs,
Legends, and Ballads</i>, and <i>In Bohemia</i>.</p>

<p class="nind2">ARTHUR O’SHAUGHNESSY. (1844-1881.)<br /><a href="#page_162">PAGE 162</a></p>

<p>O’Shaughnessy is to be ranked as an English rather than as an Irish
poet; for the national sentiment played a minor, indeed hardly a
perceptible part in his poetic life. The Celtic part of him found its
best expression in his translations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_423" id="page_423">{423}</a></span> of the <i>Lays of Marie</i>
(particularly the difficult and extraordinary “Bisclaveret”), powerful
paraphrases rather than translations. The poem by which he is
represented here shows the influence of Edgar Allan Poe, but is founded
upon a Celtic legend. In his early youth he was appointed to a
subordinate position in the Library of the British Museum, and was
afterwards promoted to the Natural History Department. His first
literary success was his <i>Epic of Women</i> (1870), a volume of exceptional
promise, which, however, was never adequately fulfilled. His <i>Lays of
France</i> (1872) was followed by <i>Music and Moonlight</i> (1874) and a
posthumous volume, <i>Songs of a Worker</i> (1881). Always delicate, his
death without any previous breakdown surprised none of his friends. I
recollect that on the Saturday preceding his death, which I think was on
a Wednesday, he came into the rooms of his brother-in-law, and
fellow-poet and friend, Philip Bourke Marston, and asked me to come to
his residence on the following Wednesday, to hear him read from the
proofs of his new book. That evening he went to a theatre, came home on
the top of an omnibus, caught a chill, and died before any of his
friends knew that he was seriously indisposed. The best critical and
biographical accounts of this charming if insubstantial poet, are to be
found in Dr Garnett’s memoir in Miles’ <i>Poets and Poetry of the
Century</i>, Vol. VIII., and in the biographical edition of his poems
recently put forth by Mrs Louise Chandler Moulton. Of the poem here
given, Dr Garnett speaks as a “miracle of melody,” and as one of the
pieces in which “the poet’s inward nature has perhaps most clearly
expressed itself.”</p>

<p class="nind2">FANNY PARNELL. (1855-1883.)<br /><a href="#page_165">PAGE 165</a></p>

<p>A remarkable poem by a remarkable woman. Frances Isabelle Parnell was
the sister of Charles Stewart Parnell, and grand-daughter of Charles
Stewart (from whom the great Irish patriot derived his baptismal names),
the historic commander of the U.S. Frigate <i>Constitution</i>. Miss
Parnell’s poems, which always appeared above the signature of Fanny
Parnell, have not yet been published collectively. She was secretary of
the Ladies’ Land League, and was as intensely wrought by the fervour of
patriotism as was her famous brother.</p>

<p class="nind2">T. W. ROLLESTON.<br /><a href="#page_166">PAGE 166</a></p>

<p>The sometime editor of the <i>Dublin University Review</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_424" id="page_424">{424}</a></span> one of the
most valued present members of the Irish Literary Society, was born at
Shinrone, King’s County, in 1857. Mr Rolleston has had a cosmopolitan
training since he left Trinity College, and has in particular been
influenced by his long residence in Germany; but he has remained a
Celtic poet and ardent Celticist through every intellectual development.
While resident in Germany and in London, he wrote his <i>Life of Lessing</i>
and his introductions to Epictetus and Plato. He is now responsibly
connected with the Irish Industries Association, but is more and not
less engrossed by his Celtic studies. If there were a few more
poet-scholars who could translate or paraphrase so beautifully as Mr
Rolleston has paraphrased the Irish of Enoch o’ Gillan (see p. 166) and
other poems, there would be a wider public in England for the lovely
work of early Irish poetry. “The Lament of Queen Maev,” given here in
the Ancient Irish section, is also a translation by Mr Rolleston.</p>

<p class="nind2">DORA SIGERSON.<br /><a href="#page_167">PAGE 167</a></p>

<p>This young and promising writer comes of poetic stock. Her sister Hester
is also a writer of verse, and her father, Dr Sigerson, is one of the
foremost workers in the Gaelic Revival. Miss Dora Sigerson’s only
published book as yet bears the modest title <i>Verses</i>. It is, perhaps,
more significant in its promise than in its achievement; and I find
nothing in it so mature as the poem by which she is represented here,
taken from a recent issue of the <i>Chap Book</i> (Stone &amp; Kimball, Chicago).
The following lines, from <i>Verses</i>, may be given as an example of her
poetic first-fruits:&mdash;</p>

<h4>IN SOUTHERN SEAS.</h4>

DR GEORGE SIGERSON.<br /><a href="#page_168">PAGE 168</a></p>

<p>The distinguished translator and editor of <i>The Poets and Poetry of
Munster</i> was born near Strabane, Co. Tyrone, in 1839. Much of his
original work has appeared above his Irish pen-name “Erionnach”; and
from first to last Dr Sigerson’s name is indissolubly associated with
the wide-reaching Celtic Renascence in Ireland.</p>

<p class="nind2">DR JOHN TODHUNTER.<br /><a href="#page_170">PAGE 170</a></p>

<p>One of the foremost contemporary poets of Ireland, was born in Dublin in
1839, and, like so many of his literary compatriots, was educated at
Trinity. He then pursued his medical studies in Paris and Vienna;
returned to Dublin and practised awhile as a physician; succeeded Prof.
Dowden as Professor of English Literature in Alexandria College; and,
since 1875, has devoted himself exclusively to literature. Some of his
lyrical pieces are known to all lovers of poetry&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> “The Banshee”;
and for the rest he has won a distinctive place for himself by work at
once varied in theme and beautiful in treatment. Though he has won
deserved reputation as a playwright for the contemporary stage, as well
as in the poetic drama, he seems to me to be at his best when most
Celtic in feeling and expression. He is represented here, not by pieces
so well known as “The Banshee” or any part of <i>The Three Sorrows of
Story-Telling</i>, but by two typical Irish poems, and one lovely fragment
(see p. 173) from <i>Forest Songs</i>. Personally, I consider the “Love Song”
given at page 170 to be one of the finest compositions of its kind in
modern Celtic literature. I have regretfully refrained from quoting two
other poems by Dr Todhunter, one familiar to every Irishman, “The Shan
Van Vocht of ’87,” beginning&mdash;</p>

KATHERINE TYNAN.<br /><a href="#page_174">PAGE 174</a></p>

<p>The author of <i>Louise de la Vallière</i> (1885), <i>Shamrocks</i> (1887),
<i>Ballads and Lyrics</i> (1891), and later volumes in prose as well as
verse, is one of the best known representatives of the Irish poetic
fellowship. Mrs Hinkson (though best known by her maiden name) is
distinctively Irish rather than Celtic, and pre-eminently a Catholicist
in the spirit of her work. She has a St Francis-like love of birds and
all defenceless creatures and humble things, and has a most happy lyric
faculty in dealing with aspects and objects which excite her rhythmic
emotion. In lyric quality and in her all-pervading sense of colour, she
is, however, characteristically Celtic. Miss Tynan was born in Dublin in
1861, but since her marriage a few years ago to Mr Hinkson (himself one
of the Dublin University <i>Young Ireland</i> men) she has resided in or near
London. Some of her work has a lyric ecstasy, of a kind which
distinguishes it from the poetry of any other woman-writer of to-day.</p>

<p class="nind">W. B. Yeats is the prince of contemporary Irish poets. While no one is
more essentially Celtic, and none is more distinctively national, his
poetry belongs to English literature. Mr Yeats himself would be the last
man to nail his flag to the mast of parochialism in literature. He is
one of the two or three absolutely poetic personalities in literature at
the present moment; and in outlook, and, above all, in atmosphere,
stands foremost in the younger generation. It is noteworthy that the two
most convincingly poetic of all our younger poets, since the giants who
(with the exception of George Meredith, A. C. Swinburne, and William
Morris) have gone from our midst, are predominantly Celtic; W. B. Yeats
and John Davidson&mdash;and noteworthy, also, that both are too wise, too
clear-sighted, too poetic, in fact, to aim at being Irish or
Scoto-Celtic at the expense of being English in the high and best sense
of the word. This, fortunately, is consistent with being paramountly
national in all else. In the world of literature there is no geography
save that of the mind.</p>

<p>Mr Yeats’ poetic work is best to be read, and perhaps best to be
enjoyed, in the revised collective edition of his poems, in one volume,
published recently by Mr Fisher Unwin. His first volume of verse, <i>The
Wanderings of Oisìn</i>, was published in 1889. This was followed (in 1892)
by <i>The Countess Kathleen: and Various Legends and Lyrics</i>; <i>The Land of
Heart’s Desire</i>, and two short prose tales (in the Pseudonym Library),
<i>John Sherman</i> and <i>Dhoya</i>. Two new books are promised in 1896 (through
Mr Elkin Mathews), <i>The Shadowy Waters</i> (a poetic play), and <i>The Wind
Among the Reeds</i> (poems). He has also published several volumes of
selected Irish tales and legendary lore; edited, in conjunction with Mr
E. J. Ellis, the <i>Works of William Blake</i> (3 vols., 1893); and <i>A Book
of Irish Verse</i> (Methuen, 1895), an interesting rather than an
adequately representative anthology of nationalistic Irish poetry. All
that is most distinctive in Mr Yeats’ own original work is to be found
in his <i>Poems</i> (Collective Edition, in 1 vol., Fisher Unwin, 1895), and
the prose volume entitled <i>The Celtic Twilight</i> (Lawrence &amp; Bullen,
1893), one of the most fascinating prose-books by a poet published in
our time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_428" id="page_428">{428}</a></span></p>

Probably by this is meant merely old Gaelic, mediæval or even later. The
translation is by Mr Thomas Pattison, and is included in his <i>Gaelic
Bards</i>. He has the following note upon it: “This effusion, although in
its original form it is only a kind of wild chant&mdash;almost indeed half
prose&mdash;yet it is the germ of the ballad. It occurs in many of the tales
contained in that collection, the repository of old Gaelic lore, the
<i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>, sometimes more and sometimes less
perfect. The original will be found in the second volume of the
Tales.... The vigorous and elastic spirit that pervades these verses
must have strung the heart of many a hardy mariner who loved to feel the
fresh and briny breeze drive his snoring birlinn bounding like a living
creature over the tumbling billows of the inland loch or the huge swell
of the majestic main.”</p>

<p class="nind2">ALEXANDER MACDONALD.<br /><a href="#page_195">PAGE 195</a></p>

<p>This celebrated Gaelic poet was born in the first half of the 17th
century. In the Highlands and Western Isles he is invariably styled <i>Mac
Mhaighstir Alastair</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the son of Mr Alexander. Alastair the Elder
resided at Dalilea in Moydart of Argyll, and was both Episcopal
clergyman and official tacksman. He was a man of immense strength and
vigour, and his muscular Christianity may be inferred from the saying
current in Moydart that “his hand was heavier on the men of Suainart
than on the men of Moydart.” Alexander Macdonald had a good education
for his time<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_429" id="page_429">{429}</a></span>&mdash;first under his father, and later, for a year or so, at
Glasgow University. Poverty, however, compelled him to leave Glasgow and
retire to Ardnamurchan, where, as his biographer, Mr Pattison, says, he
lived, teaching and farming, and composing poetry, until the advent of
the year 1745. In this momentous year he left not only his farm and his
teaching, but even his eldership in the Established Church, and forsook
all to join Prince Charlie, and to take upon him the onus of a change to
the detested Roman Catholic faith. He was a Jacobite of the Jacobites,
and his fiery and warlike songs were repeated from mouth to mouth
throughout Celtic Scotland. It is supposed that he had a commission in
the Highland army of the Prince, though whether he served as an officer
is uncertain; at any rate, after the battle of Culloden he had to share
the privations of his leaders, and he lived in hiding in the woods and
caves of the district of Arisaig. On one occasion, when lurking among
these caves with his brother Angus, the cold was so intense that the
side of Macdonald’s head which rested on the ground became quite grey in
a single night. When the troubles were over he went to Edinburgh, where
he taught the children of a staunch Jacobite, but soon returned to his
beloved West, where he remained till his death. Macdonald’s first
published book was a <i>Gaelic and English Vocabulary</i> (1741), nor was it
till ten years later that his poems were published in Edinburgh&mdash;said to
be one of the earliest volumes of original poems ever published in
Gaelic. Pattison declares that he is the most warlike, and much the
fiercest of the Highland poets; and altogether ranks him as, if not the
foremost, certainly second only to the famous Duncan Bàn MacIntyre. His
poem called “The Birlinn of the Clan-Ranald” is by this critic, and most
others, ranked as the finest composition in Modern Gaelic; certainly
many Highlanders prefer it even to the “Coire Cheathaich,” or the still
more famous “Ben Dorain” of Duncan Bàn. Assuredly no one could read this
poem “Of the hurling of the birlinn through the cold glens of the sea,
loudly snoring,” without being stirred by its vigour and power. The
portion here given is merely a fragment, for the original is much too
long for quotation&mdash;indeed, it is said to be the longest poem in Gaelic,
except such as are Ossianic. For a full account of Macdonald and his
poems, including the translation of the greater part of “The Manning of
the Birlinn,” see Pattison’s <i>Gaelic Bards</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_430" id="page_430">{430}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind2">ANGUS MACKENZIE.<br /><a href="#page_201">PAGE 201</a></p>

<p>“The Lament of the Deer” is the work of a favourite Highland poet whose
name is particularly familiar in the Northern Highlands. Angus Mackenzie
was head forester of Lord Lovat, and most of his poems have the impress
of his well-loved profession. “The Cumha nam Fiadh” was composed during
the recovery from a severe illness, when the poet’s chief regret was his
inability to be with Lovat and his Frasers at the hunting of the stag.
The translation here given was made by Charles Edward and John Sobieski
Stuart, and is to be found in their <i>Lays of the Deer Forest</i>
(Blackwood, 1848).</p>

<p class="nind2">DUNCAN BÀN MACINTYRE.<br /><a href="#page_203">PAGE 203</a></p>

<p>A name loved throughout the Highlands and Islands. Even the most
illiterate crofters are familiar with Duncan Bàn and much of his poetry,
and there are few who could not repeat at least some lines of “Ben
Dorain.” The Hunter Bard of Glenorchy, as he is often called&mdash;though his
best title is the affectionate Gaelic “Duncan of the Songs”&mdash;was born on
the 20th of March 1724, at Druimliaghart in Glenorchy, Argyll. His first
song was composed on a sword with which he was armed at the battle of
Falkirk&mdash;where he served on the Royalist side as substitute for a
gentleman of the neighbourhood. “This sword,” says his biographer,
Thomas Pattison, “the poet lost or threw away in the retreat. On his
return home therefore, the gentleman to whom it belonged, and whose
substitute he had been, refused to pay the sum for which he had engaged
Duncan Bàn to serve in his stead. Duncan consequently composed his song
on ‘The Battle of the Speckled Kirk’&mdash;as Falkirk is called in Gaelic&mdash;in
which he good-humouredly satirised the gentleman who had sent him to the
war, and gave a woful description of ‘the black sword that worked the
turmoil,’ and whose loss, he says, made its owner ‘as fierce and furious
as a grey brock in his den.’ The song immediately became popular, and
incensed his employer so much that he suddenly fell upon the poor poet
one day with his walking-stick, and, striking him on the back, bade him
‘go and make a song about that.’ He was, however, afterward compelled by
the Earl of Breadalbane to pay the bard the sum of 300 merks Scots (£16,
17s. 6d.), which was his legal due.” Although in his later years he was
for a time one of the Duke of Argyll’s foresters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_431" id="page_431">{431}</a></span> most of his later
life was spent in Edinburgh, where he was one of the City Guard. In that
city he died in 1812, in his eighty-ninth year, and lies in Greyfriars
Churchyard. In all there have been seven editions of his <i>Gaelic Songs</i>.
“Ben Dorain” has been translated several times, most successfully by
Thomas Pattison and the late Professor Blackie. The version here given
is that of the former; while the following poem (“The Hill Water,” page
208) is that of Professor Blackie.</p>

<p>Translations of both “Ben Dorain” (in full) and of “Coire Cheathaich”
(The Misty Corrie) are included in Pattison’s <i>Gaelic Bards</i>. Professor
Blackie’s version of “Ben Dorain” is in his well-known book, <i>Altavona</i>.</p>

<p class="nind2">MARY MACLEOD.<br /><a href="#page_210">PAGE 210</a></p>

<p>The most famous of Hebridean poets was born in Harris of the Outer
Hebrides in 1569. She may be regarded either as the last of the poets of
the Middle Scoto-Celtic period, or, more properly, as the first of the
moderns. She is generally spoken of in the Western Isles as Màiri
nighean Alastair Ruaidh (Mary, daughter of Alexander the Red). “Although
she could never either read or write, her poetry is pure and chaste in
its diction, melodious, though complicated, in its metre, clear and
graceful, and frequently pathetic” (Pattison). She died at Dunvegan, in
the Isle of Skye, in 1674, at the great age of 105. For some reason,
Mary Macleod was banished from Dunvegan by Macleod of Macleod, but his
heart was melted by the song here given, and the exile was recalled, and
that, too, with honour, and enabled to live in Macleod’s country
thenceforth in prosperity and happiness.</p>

baby. <i>Coineachan</i> is a term of endearment applied to a child. (Quoted

law. This he forsook for literature, and ultimately, in 1852, was
appointed to the Greek Chair in Edinburgh University. All particulars of
the brilliant Professor’s life and writings will be found in the
recently-published biography by Miss Anna Stoddart. Professor Blackie’s
name will always be held in affectionate regard for his unselfish
efforts to preserve and cultivate the Gaelic language and literature,
and because of his having been mainly instrumental in founding the Chair
of Celtic Literature in the University of Edinburgh. His poetical
writings are mostly to be found in <i>Lays and Legends of Ancient Greece</i>
(1857), <i>Lyrical Poems</i> (1860), and <i>Lays of the Highlands and Islands</i>
(1872).</p>

<p class="nind2">ROBERT BUCHANAN.<br /><a href="#page_224">PAGE 224</a></p>

<p>The foremost Scoto-Celtic poet of our time, was born in Glasgow, 1841.
It would be needless to give particulars concerning the life and work of
so eminent a contemporary. Lovers of the Celtic Muse will doubtless be
familiar (or if not, ought to be) with Mr Buchanan’s <i>Book of Orm</i>. Much
of his early poetry is strongly imbued with the Celtic atmosphere. Those
who have read his several volumes of verse need no further guidance, but
readers unacquainted with the poetical work of one of the foremost poets
of our day should obtain the collective edition of his poems published
by Messrs Chatto &amp; Windus. “The Flower of the World” (page 224), “The
Dream of the World without Death” (pages 228-234) are from <i>The Book of
Orm</i>; “The Strange Country” comes from <i>Miscellaneous Poems and Ballads</i>
(1878-1883). No more memorable poem than “The Dream” has been written by
an Anglo-Celtic poet.</p>

<p>Byron is represented in <i>Lyra Celtica</i> by virtue of his Celtic blood and
undoubtedly Celtic nature, rather than because there is much trace of
Celtic influence in his poetry. The two lyrics given here may be taken
as fairly representative of that part of his poetical work which may
with some reason be called Celtic, though, of course, there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_433" id="page_433">{433}</a></span>
in them which radically differentiates them from the lyrics of any
English poet. More than one eminent critic, foreign as well as British,
has claimed for Byron that he was the representative Celtic voice of the
early part of the century; but Byron was really much more the voice of
his own day and time than anything more restricted.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous pipe-tune in the Highlands is the “Cumha mhic
Criomein,” composed by Donald Bàn MacCrimmon, on the occasion of the
Clan MacLeod, headed by their chief, embarking to join the Royalists in
1746. The Lament is said to have been composed by Donald Bàn under the
influence of a presentiment that he as well as many others of the clan
would never return; a presentiment fulfilled, for he was killed in a
skirmish near Moyhall. The tune and the chorus are old, but it is
commonly believed the poem was composed by Dr Norman Macleod; at any
rate, they first appeared in a Gaelic article on the MacCrimmons, which
he contributed in 1840 to “Cuairtear nan Gleann” (“Fionn,” the <i>Celtic
Monthly</i>). The translation here given is that of Professor Blackie.</p>

<p>Mr Davidson was born at Barrhead, near Paisley, on April 11th, 1857.
After his preliminary education at the Highlanders’ Academy, Greenock,
he went to Edinburgh University. For a time he taught in Greenock, and
also gained a certain amount of literary experience in occasional
contributions to the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> and other papers. In 1886 he
published <i>Bruce: a Drama</i>, followed by <i>Smith: a Tragedy</i> (1888),
<i>Scaramouch in Naxos: and other Places</i> (1889), <i>In a Music Hall, and
other Poems</i> (1891), <i>Fleet Street Eclogues</i> (1893), <i>Ballads and Songs</i>
(1894), <i>Second Series of Fleet Street Eclogues</i> (1895), besides several
volumes of prose papers and fiction. Although <i>Bruce</i> was Mr Davidson’s
first published work, he had begun to write at a much earlier period:
his <i>An Historical Pastoral</i> was composed in 1877; <i>A Romantic Farce</i> in
1878;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_434" id="page_434">{434}</a></span> while <i>Bruce</i> was written four years before its publication. Mr
Davidson’s later poetical writings have been mainly in the form of songs
and lyrical ballads, and these have placed him in the foremost rank of
the younger poets of to-day. He has the widest range, the largest
manner, and the intensest note of any of the later Victorians. The two
poems by which he is represented here are eminently characteristic, and
none the less Celtic in their essential quality from the fact that the
one deals with a loafer of the London streets and the other with a
scenic rendering of an impression gained in Romney Marsh. Mr Davidson’s
latest writings are “The Ballad of an Artist’s Wife,” not as yet issued
in book form, and the just published second series of the <i>Fleet Street
Eclogues</i> (John Lane). Both “A Loafer” and “In Romney Marsh” are from
<i>Ballads and Songs</i>.</p>

less widely known, though in them he has expressed himself with great
variety and subtlety. The Celtic element is not conspicuous in Dr
Macdonald’s work either in prose or verse; but sometimes, as in the

<p>There is no Highlander held in more affectionate remembrance and
admiration than the late Dr Norman Macleod: and with justice; for no one
worked more arduously, understandingly, and sympathetically for the
cause of the Gaelic language, Gaelic literature, and the Gaelic people
than the famous poet-minister, who, to this day, is commonly spoken of
as “The Great Norman.” It was, however, Dr Norman the elder who wrote
“Fiunary,”&mdash;and not, as commonly stated, the late Dr Norman. His
“Farewell to Fiunary” is probably the most universally-known modern poem
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_436" id="page_436">{436}</a></span> the West Highlands. (For critical remarks as to the authenticity of
this poem, see Dr Nigel M‘Neil’s <i>Literature of the Highlanders</i>, pp.

<p class="nind2">SARAH ROBERTSON MATHESON.<br /><a href="#page_267">PAGE 267</a></p>

<p>Mrs Robertson Matheson, some of whose poems in periodicals have
attracted the attention of lovers of poetry, is chief secretary and
treasurer of the Clan Donnachaidh Society. The fine lyric, “A Kiss of
the King’s Hand,” appeared in the <i>Celtic Monthly</i> for May 1894; but I
regret that version has inadvertently been followed, for it twice
misspells <i>tae</i> for “to,” and in the third line of the third quatrain
has a misreading (“jewels” instead of “ruffles”).</p>

<p>It may interest many readers to know that “A Kiss of the King’s Hand”
decided the descendant of Flora Macdonald to leave Mrs Robertson
Matheson the last heirloom of Scottish romance, the “ring of French
gold” given by Prince Charlie to Flora, and holding the lock of hair cut
from “the king’s head” by her and her mother.</p>

<p class="nind2">DUGALD MOORE.<br /><a href="#page_268">PAGE 268</a></p>

<p>“The First Ship” is so remarkable a poem that it is difficult to
understand how it has met with so little recognition, and escaped most,
if not all, of the Scottish and British anthologists. Dugald Moore was
the son of Highland parents, and was born in Glasgow in 1805. His first
book was entitled <i>The Bard of the North</i>, and consisted of a series of
poetical tales illustrative of Highland scenery and character (1833).
<i>The Hour of Retribution</i> and <i>The Devoted One</i> appeared respectively in
1835 and 1839. Moore died unmarried in the 36th year of his age (Jan. 2,
1841), and was buried in the Necropolis of Glasgow. It is a pity that
the poem could not have appeared without its fourth stanza, which is
inferior to the others.</p>

Baroness Nairne was mainly Celtic in blood and wholly Celtic in genius.

and while his father was also of partial Celtic origin, Sir Noël is,
through his mother, the descendant of the last of the Scoto-Celtic
kings. Of his career as a painter it is not necessary to speak here. His
two volumes of poetry are <i>Poems by a Painter</i> (1861) and <i>Spindrift</i>
(1867). The best account of the life and work of this distinguished Scot
is the monograph recently published by Mr David Croal Thomson, as the
“Art-Annual” of <i>The Art Journal</i>. The two poems by which Sir Noël is
represented in this book are not to be found in either of his volumes,

<h3>CONTEMPORARY ANGLO-CELTIC POETS (WALES)</h3>

<p class="nind2">GEORGE MEREDITH.<br /><a href="#page_283">PAGE 283</a></p>

<p>Mr George Meredith, who recently has been addressed in a dedication as
“The Prince of Celtdom,” is rather the sovereign of contemporary English
literature. Although of Welsh descent and sympathies, and with a nature
pre-eminently Celtic in its distinguishing characteristics, Mr Meredith
was born in Hampshire on February 12th, 1828. Part of his early
education was received in Germany, and after his return to England it
was intended that he should pursue the legal profession: an intention
set aside on account of an irresistible bias toward literature. His
first published writings were in verse: and now this early little book,
<i>Poems</i>, published in his twenty-third year (1851) is one of the rarest
treasures for the bibliophile. It is dedicated to Thomas Love Peacock,
whose intellectual influence upon the young writer is obvious. In 1850
the poet married the daughter of Peacock, but it was not till a year or
two later that he definitely set himself to the profession of literature
as also a means of livelihood. It is characteristic of him that his
first prose book should be one of his most individual writings; for <i>The
Shaving of Shagpat</i> might have been written at almost any period of its
author’s career. A fascinating and perplexing production it must indeed
have seemed at that time, published as it was in a year which, with the
exception of two radically distinct American works of pre-eminent note,
Longfellow’s <i>Hiawatha</i> and Walt Whitman’s <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, was a
singularly barren one. The fantasy has always remained a favourite with
staunch Meredithians. It was followed two years later by the somewhat
akin <i>Farina</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_439" id="page_439">{439}</a></span> and two years passed again before that first important
work appeared which so profoundly affected the minds and imagination of
Mr Meredith’s contemporaries&mdash;the now famous <i>Ordeal of Richard
Feverel</i>, (1859). Since that date Mr Meredith has given us what many
consider the greatest literary legacy of our time; and unquestionably he
has had no compeer in brilliant delineation of life at white heat. It is
unnecessary to specify the works of an author with which all lovers of
literature must be familiar; but a word must be added as to the delight
which the reading world has known this year in the publication of <i>The
Amazing Marriage</i>, one of the most brilliant and vivid of all Mr
Meredith’s romances, and, in its display of his characteristic quality
at his best, ranking with <i>Harry Richmond</i>, <i>The Egoist</i>, and <i>Diana of
the Crossways</i>. As a poet George Meredith is less widely known, or,
rather, is less widely accepted. There are, nevertheless, many who
regard his poetic achievement as perhaps the most essential part of what
he has given us. In depth of thought, in clarity of vision, and in
remarkable expressional subtlety,&mdash;often, if not invariably, set forth
in a lyric utterance whose only fault is that of an occasional apparent
incoherence due to rapidity of thought and eagerness of rhythmic
emotion&mdash;he stands here, as in all else, alone. From that
extraordinarily powerful study of contemporary life, expressed
emotionally and rhythmically in singularly convincing verse, <i>Modern
Love</i>, to his latest volume, <i>The Empty Purse</i>, there is a range of
rhythmic and lyric beauty which may well be a challenge to posterity to
redeem the relative neglect of the mass of Mr Meredith’s contemporaries.
I am not of those who consider Mr Meredith’s least popular poems as mere
cryptic utterances in verse; for everywhere I find the lyric
spirit,&mdash;hampered, at times, it is true, by a wind-rush of images, and
by a sudden drove of unshepherded words. But who could read “Love in the
Valley,” “The Lark Ascending,” “The Woods of Westermain,” “The
South-Wester,” “The Hymn to Colour,” to mention five only, without
recognising that here indeed we have one of the great poets of our time.
The poems by which, owing to the gracious courtesy of Mr Meredith&mdash;who
has consented to forego for once his great objection to the appearance
of any of his poems in miscellaneous collections&mdash;he is here
represented, are from his later volumes. The “Dirge in Woods,” “Outer
and Inner,” and the superb “Hymn to Colour,” are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_440" id="page_440">{440}</a></span> from <i>A Reading of
Earth</i> (1888), the volume which contains “Hard Weather,” “The
South-Wester,” “The Thrush in February,” “The Appeasement of Demeter,”
“Woodland Peace,” the noble ode “Meditation under Stars,” and that
flawless and memorable sonnet, “Winter Heavens.” The “Night of Frost in
May” is from the volume entitled <i>The Empty Purse</i> (1892). Mr Meredith’s
other volume of poetry, the favourite with most of his readers, is
<i>Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth</i> (1883). This book includes “The
Woods of Westermain,” “The Day of the Daughter of Hades,” “The Lark
Ascending,” “Phœbus with Admetus,” “Melampus,” “Love in a Valley,” and
the group of sonnets beginning with “Lucifer in Starlight,” and ending
with “Time and Sentiment.” All Mr Meredith’s poetical writings are now
published by Messrs Macmillan.</p>

<p class="nind2">SEBASTIAN EVANS.<br /><a href="#page_292">PAGE 292</a></p>

<p>Born in 1830, the grandson of the Rev. Lewis Evans, a well-known Welsh
astronomer, and the son of the Rev. Arthur Benoni Evans, a linguist,
scholar, and author. He was not the only one of this parentage who came
to some distinction, for his brother, John Evans, F.R.S., became
President of the Society of Antiquaries, and his sister, Anne, had some
repute as a poetess and musician. Sebastian Evans won a fair measure of
fugitive fame by his <i>Brother Fabian’s Manuscript and Other Poems</i>
(Macmillan, 1865). In the early ’70’s Dr Evans published his second
volume, <i>In the Studio: a Decade of Poems</i> (Macmillan). The true note of
his strangely subtle and illusive muse is not that of either irony or
audacity as commonly supposed, but rather a living belief in the passage
of the contemporary mind and aspiration from the sureties of the ancient
faith to the assurance of a still finer faith to come. Among his short
poems perhaps the most indicative is that entitled “The Banners”&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem">

<p class="nind2">EBENEZER JONES. (1820-1860.)<br /><a href="#page_293">PAGE 293</a></p>

<p>Of Welsh parentage and descent, Ebenezer Jones was born in Islington,
London. Much has been written upon the famous Chartist poet, both in his
relation to the socialistic movements in which he participated, and in
literary criticism of his two at one time much discussed volumes,
<i>Studies of Sensation and Event</i> (1843), and <i>Studies of Resemblance and
Consent</i> (1849); but perhaps the best critical summary of his life-work
is that of Mr Wm. J. Linton in Miles’ <i>Poets and Poetry of the Century</i>,
Vol. V. The two poems by which Ebenezer Jones is represented here are
respectively from his second and first volumes.</p>

<p class="nind2">EMILY DAVIS (MRS PFEIFFER). (1841-1890.)<br /><a href="#page_296">PAGE 296</a></p>

<p>Mrs Pfeiffer, many of whose poems achieved a wide popularity, was the
daughter of a Welsh gentleman settled in Oxfordshire, and an officer in
the army. She was born in Wales. Of her several volumes of verse, the
first was <i>Gerard’s Monument</i>, etc. (1873), and the best are <i>Sonnets
and Other Songs</i>, <i>Under the Aspens</i> (1884), and <i>Sonnets</i> (1887).</p>

<p class="nind2">ERNEST RHYS.<br /><a href="#page_297">PAGE 297</a></p>

<p>“The House of Hendra” is not given here intact: for the whole poem, see
<i>A London Rose</i>, etc. (Elkin Mathews). Mr Rhys is the most noteworthy of
the younger generation of Welsh poets and romancists, and may well be
accepted as the leader of the Neo-Celtic movement in Wales. He has in a
more marked degree than almost any of his compatriots of his own period
the gift of style; and already his enthusiasm, knowledge, and fine and
notable work in prose and verse have brought him to the front as the
recognised representative of young Wales. Of Welsh parentage, Mr Rhys
was born in London in 1860, spent much of his boyhood in South Wales,
and his youth and early manhood in the north-country, where he intended
to follow the profession of a mining engineer. However, he came to
London in the early ’eighties and settled down to literary work. His
first publication in book form was <i>The Great Cockney Tragedy</i> (1891).
His poems first became known to the outside reading world through his
contributions to <i>The Book of the Rhymers’ Club</i> (1893). In the
following year he published his first and as yet sole volume of verse:
<i>A London Rose: and Other Rhymes</i>, whence comes the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_442" id="page_442">{442}</a></span> “House of
Hendra” by which he is represented here. Besides other writings, in
prose, Mr Ernest Rhys was editor of the “Camelot Series” of popular
reprints and translations in 65 volumes (1885-1890), and now is critical
editor of <i>The Lyric Poets</i> (Dent), one of the most delightful
poets-series extant.</p>

<h3>CONTEMPORARY ANGLO-CELTIC POETS (MANX)</h3>

<p class="nind2">THOMAS EDWARD BROWN.<br /><a href="#page_307">PAGE 307</a></p>

<p>Was born at Douglas, in the Isle of Man, in 1830. After a career of
exceptional distinction at Oxford, he was appointed Vice-Principal of
King William’s College in the Isle of Man (1855). Since 1863 he has been
assistant-master of Clifton College. The book by which Mr Brown is best
known is his admirable <i>Fo’c’sle Yarns</i> (Macmillan, 1881 and 1889),
though the first of his tales in verse included therein, “Betsy Lee,”
appeared in <i>Macmillan’s Magazine</i> in 1873 where it at once attracted
wide attention. He has also published <i>The Doctor</i> (1887) and <i>The Manx
Witch</i> (1889). The author of <i>Fo’c’sle Yarns</i> is by far the most
noteworthy poetic representative of the Isle of Man. In range, depth of
insight, dramatic vigour, keen sympathy, and narrative faculty, all
transformed by the alchemy of his poetic vision, he is not only the
foremost Manx poet, but one of the most notable of living writers in
verse. It is probably because most of his poems deal almost wholly with
Manx scenes and characters, and are for the most part written in the
Manx dialect, that he is so little talked of by literary critics and so
little known to the reading world at large. Than “Betsy Lee” (<i>Fo’c’sle
Yarns</i>) there is no more moving, human, and beautiful poem, of the
narrative kind, written in our time. The fragmentary lines by which the
author is represented here were selected from one of his most
characteristic Manx poems, and give a good idea of the common parlance
of the islanders of to-day. It is from <i>The Doctor: and Other Poems</i>
(Swan Sonnenschein, 1887).</p>

<p class="nind2">HALL CAINE.<br /><a href="#page_309">PAGE 309</a></p>

<p>This fine Manx ballad of “Graih my Chree” appeared this year in the
first number of <i>London Home</i>, to the editor and proprietor of which, as
well as to Mr Hall Caine, I am indebted for the permission to include
“Love of my Heart” here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_443" id="page_443">{443}</a></span> Mr Caine, so celebrated as a novelist, has
published no volume of poems; but at rare intervals something of his in
verse has appeared. I think that his earliest appearance as a poet was
in <i>Sonnets of this Century</i> (1886, and later editions), where he is
represented by two fine sonnets, “Where Lies the Land to which my Soul
would go?” and “After Sunset.” Mr Caine’s own first acknowledged book
was an anthology of sonnets (<i>Sonnets of Three Centuries</i>, Stock, 1882),
published in the author’s twenty-seventh year. Of his many books, the
best known are his <i>Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</i>; and his
romances, <i>The Shadow of a Crime</i>, <i>The Deemster</i>, <i>The Bondman</i>, <i>The
Scapegoat</i>, and <i>The Manxman</i>. Mr Hall Caine is himself a Manxman,
crossed with a strong strain of Cumberland blood. Both in his strength
and weakness he is eminently Celtic, after his own kind; for he could
belong to no other Celtic people than either the Manx or the Welsh. He
has, and not without good reason, been called the Walter Scott of Man.
Certainly, <i>The Deemster</i> and <i>The Manxman</i> alone have revealed Manxland
and Manx life and character to the great mass of English readers.</p>

<h3>CONTEMPORARY ANGLO-CELTIC POETS (CORNISH)</h3>

<p class="nind2">ARTHUR THOMAS QUILLER COUCH.<br /><a href="#page_317">PAGE 317</a></p>

<p>So well known as “Q,” was born at Bodwin, in Cornwall, of an old Cornish
family, in 1863. He left Trinity College, Oxford, for London; but, after
a brief experience of literary life in the metropolis, returned to the
“Duchy,” and has since resided there, mainly at Fowey. He is not only
the most noteworthy living Cornishman of letters, and the romancer <i>par
excellence</i> of contemporary Cornwall and Cornish life, but is
acknowledged as one of the best story-tellers of the day. His first book
was <i>The Splendid Spur</i> (1889), a stirring romance, which was followed
by <i>The Delectable Duchy</i>, <i>Noughts and Crosses</i>, and <i>I Saw Three
Ships</i>. He has published little poetry; and even in his slender volume,
<i>Green Bays</i> (1893), there are not more than one or two poems, the other
verses being for the most part what are called “occasional.” If,
however, he had written nothing in verse except the lyric called “The
Splendid Spur,” he would be accounted a poet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_444" id="page_444">{444}</a></span> remembrance. “The
White Moth” is the most distinctively Celtic poem he has written. In the
main, he is more Cornish than Celtic&mdash;in this a contrast to Dr Riccardo
Stephens, who is far more distinctively Celtic than Cornish.</p>

<p class="nind2">ROBERT STEPHEN HAWKER. (1804-1875.)<br /><a href="#page_319">PAGE 319</a></p>

<p>The celebrated vicar of Morwenstow (born at Plymouth) came of an old
Cornish family, and spent the greater part of his life in the Duchy. In
1834 he became Vicar of Morwenstow, a remote parish on the Cornish
sea-board. His best-known book is <i>Cornish Ballads</i> (1869); but the
reader who may not be acquainted with his writings should consult the
<i>Poetical Works, and Other Literary Remains, with a Memoir</i> (1879).
Hawker has much of the sombre note which is supposed to be
characteristic of Celtic Cornwall.</p>

<p class="nind2">RICCARDO STEPHENS.<br /><a href="#page_321">PAGE 321</a></p>

<p>Dr Stephens is a Cornishman settled in Edinburgh, where he practises as
a physician. He has not, as yet, published any of his poems in book
form; but, none the less, has won (if necessarily, as yet, a limited)
reputation by his exceedingly vigorous and individual poems. He has
written several “Castle Ballads” (of which the very striking “Hell’s
Piper” given here is one)&mdash;poems suggested by legendary episodes
connected with Edinburgh Castle, or perhaps only vaguely influenced by
that romantically picturesque and grand vicinage&mdash;for Dr Stephens is one
of the many workers, thinkers, and dreamers who congregate in the
settlement founded by Professor Patrick Geddes on the site of Allan
Ramsay’s residence&mdash;“New Edinburgh,” as University Hall is sometimes
called, an apt name in more ways than one. Dr Stephens is a poet of
marked originality, and his work has all the Celtic fire and fervour,
with much of that sombre gloom which is held to be characteristically
Cornish. “Hell’s Piper” has lines in it of Dantesque vigour, as those
which depict, among “the shackled earthquakes,” the “reeking halls of
Hell,” and the torture-wrought denizens of that Inferno. “The Phantom
Piper” will never be forgotten by any one who has once read and been
thrilled by this highly-imaginative poem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_445" id="page_445">{445}</a></span></p>

<h3>MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY BRETON</h3>

<p class="nind2">THE POOR CLERK (IN BRETON, “AR C’HLOAREK PAOUR”)<br /><a href="#page_331">PAGE 331</a></p>

<p class="nind2">is rather a mediæval than a modern folk-poem. The translation is that of
the late Tom Taylor (<i>Ballads and Lyrics</i>, Macmillan), who has the
following note upon it:&mdash;“The Klöarek is a seminarist of Tréguier, a
peasant who has a turn for books, or shows some vocation for the
priesthood. Their miserable life, hard study, and abnegation of family
life are provocative of regretful emotion, passionate and mystic
asceticism. The Klöarek is the poet and hero of most of the Breton
<i>Sônes</i>; Tréguier, therefore, is the nursery of the elegaic and
religious popular poetry of Brittany.”</p>

<p class="nind2">THE CROSS BY THE WAY (KROAZ ANN HENT).<br /><a href="#page_332">PAGE 332</a></p>

<p class="nind2">
THE SECRETS OF THE CLERK, AND LOVE SONG. <br />     <a href="#page_335">PAGES 335-337</a><br />
</p>

<p>See Note to “The Poor Clerk.” The first of these poems was probably
composed in the transition period&mdash;late mediæval or early modern. Both
are given in the rendering of Mr Alfred M. Williams (<i>vide</i> “Folk-Songs
of Lower Brittany” in <i>Studies in Folk-Song and Popular Poetry</i> (1895)).
“The Love Song” is modern&mdash;probably <i>circa</i> 1800, or even 1750.</p>

<p class="nind2">
HERVÉ NOËL LE BRETON.<br /><a href="#page_338">PAGE 338</a></p>

<p>For all particulars concerning this poet I must refer interested readers
to Mr W. J. Robertson’s brief memoir in that most delightful of all
books of translation, <i>A Century of French Verse</i> (A. D. Innes &amp; Co.,
1895). This is without exception the ablest work of its kind we have. It
is the production of one who is unmistakably himself a poet, who has the
rare double power to translate literally, and at the same time with
subtle art and charm, so that the least possible loss in translation is
involved. In addition to these often exquisitely felicitous, and always
notably able and suggestive renderings, Mr Robertson has prefixed to
each representative selection a brief critical and biographical study of
the poet represented&mdash;short <i>études</i> of remarkable insight and critical
merit. Of Hervé Noël le Breton he gives some interesting particulars.
The poet is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_446" id="page_446">{446}</a></span> of the ancient Armorican race, and was born in Nantes in
1851. He has not yet published any volume; and it is from an unpublished
collection, <i>Rêves et Symboles</i>, that Mr Robertson has drawn. Strangely
enough, neither in Tiercelin’s Breton Anthology nor anywhere else can I
find any allusion to Hervé Noël le Breton: and his name is unknown to M.
Louis Tiercelin, M. Anatole le Braz, and M. Charles Le Goffic,
respectively the most eminent living Breton anthologist, Breton
folk-lorist, and Breton poet-romancist and critic. For several reasons I
take it that Le Breton is an assumed name; and it is even possible that
the Armorican blood is only in the brain, and not in the body of the
author of <i>Rêves et Symboles</i>. “The Burden of Lost Souls” is in three
parts, of which that given here is the first. Here is the second:</p>

<p class="nind">Mr Robertson gives four poems by this poet: “<i>La Plainte des Damnés</i>,”
“<i>Vers les Etoiles</i>,” “<i>Le Tombeau du Poète</i>,” and “<i>Hymne au Sommeil</i>.”
His translation of the last-named also appears in this anthology.</p>

<p class="nind2">
VILLIERS DE L’ISLE-ADAM. (1838-1889.)<br /><a href="#page_342">PAGE 342</a></p>

<p>This famous French novelist and poet was born at St Brieuc, in Brittany,
of parents who were each of old Breton stock. The full details of the
life and work of Philippe-Auguste-Mathias de Villiers de l’Isle-Adam,
son of the Marquis Joseph de Villiers de l’Isle-Adam and his wife Marie
Françoise le Nepveu de Carfort, can be read in the recently-published
<i>Life</i>, by the late Vicomte Robert du Pontavice de Heussey&mdash;an English
translation of which, by Lady Mary Lloyd, was issued last year by Mr
Heinemann. This distinguished writer lived in misfortune, and died amid
darker shadows than those he had too long been bitterly acquainted with.
His first volume of poems was published when he was little more than
twenty years old&mdash;as Mr Robertson says, “one of the most remarkable ever
written by so young a poet.” The young Breton poet came under the strong
personal influence of Baudelaire, and in the process he lost much of his
native Celtic fire and spirituality. Besides the poems given here,
“Confession” (“<i>D’aveu</i>”) and “Discouragement” (“<i>Découragement</i>”), Mr
Robertson translates, in his <i>Century of French Verse</i>,
“<i>Eblouissement</i>” and “<i>Les Présents</i>.”</p>

<p class="nind2">LECONTE DE LISLE. (1818-1894.)<br /><a href="#page_344">PAGE 344</a></p>

<p>“The great Creole poet, Charles Marie René Leconte, known as Leconte de
Lisle, was the child of a Breton father and a Gascon mother, and was
born at St Paul, in the isle of Bourbon (<i>Réunion</i>) in 1818. He had the
Celtic clearness of vision and love of beauty, and the vigour and
courage of the Pyrenean race. In his youth he travelled through the East
Indies, and the vivid impressions of tropical colour and warmth which
are visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_448" id="page_448">{448}</a></span> in his poetry derive their value from the personal
observation of Nature in those regions” (W. J. Robertson, <i>A Century of
French Verse</i>). Leconte de Lisle, one of the greatest of modern French
poets, is assured of immortality by his beautiful trilogy:&mdash;<i>Poèmes
Antiques</i> (1852), <i>Poèmes Barbares</i> (1862), and <i>Poèmes Tragiques</i>
(1884). The reader who, unfamiliar with this poet, wishes to know more
of Leconte de Lisle and his work, cannot do better than turn first to Mr
Robertson’s biographical and critical memoir in <i>A Century of French
Verse</i>. There, too, he will find five poems from <i>Poèmes Antiques</i>,
including the long “<i>Dies Iræ</i>”; two from <i>Poèmes Barbares</i>, and two
from <i>Poèmes Tragiques</i>. Of the two given here, the first (“The Black
Panther”) is from <i>Poèmes Barbares</i>, and “The Spring” (“<i>La Source</i>”)
from <i>Poèmes Antiques</i>. Leconte de Lisle strove after an ideal
perfection of form. The spirit of that almost flawless work of his, is
of intellectual emotion rather than of passion; but in colour, and
splendour of imagery, no romanticist can surpass him. He is of the great
minds who create, calm and serene. He is often classed with the two
great master-spirits of modern German and French literature; but, while
he has neither the lyric rush nor epic sweep of Victor Hugo, nor the
philosophical modernity and innate human sentiment of Gœthe, he is much
more akin to the latter than to the former. For the rest, to quote Mr
Robertson, “he gives the noblest expression to human revolt and desire,
to ideal dreams, and to the pure and sometimes pathetic love of external
nature.”</p>

<p class="nind2">LEO-KERMORVAN.<br /><a href="#page_348">PAGE 348</a></p>

<p>Leo-Kermorvan has been represented here as one of the most distinctively
Celtic of the contemporary Breton poets. In translating his “Taliesen,”
as well as Louis Tiercelin’s “By Menec’hi Shore,” I have endeavoured to
convey the atmosphere, as well as to be literal; and, partly to this
end, and partly because of a personal preference for unrhymed metrical
translation, have not ventured to make a rhymed paraphrase. M. Kermorvan
is a poet worthy to be named with his two most notable living
compatriots, Tristran Corbière and Charles Le Goffic.</p>

<p class="nind2">LOUIS TIERCELIN.<br /><a href="#page_351">PAGE 351</a></p>

<p>(See foregoing note.) M. Tiercelin is a Breton poet and critic, perhaps
best known as co-editor of the <i>Parnasse de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_449" id="page_449">{449}</a></span> Bretagne</i>. No more
characteristic Breton poem, apart from folk-poetry, could close <i>Lyra
Celtica</i>. It is the keynote of the poetry that is common to all the
Celtic races.</p>

<p>THE CELTIC FRINGE</p>

<p class="nind2">BLISS CARMAN.<br /><a href="#page_355">PAGE 355</a></p>

<p>Mr Bliss Carman, the trans-Atlantic poet who, it seems to me, has the
most distinctive note of any American poet (and the word “American” is
used in its widest sense), is of Scoto-Celtic descent through his
father’s side, and of East-Anglian through the maternal side; but was
born of a family long settled in Canada&mdash;viz., at Fredericton, New
Brunswick, in 1861. His poetry is intensely individual, and with a lyric
note at once poignant and reserved. Work of very high quality is
expected of him, on both sides of the Atlantic; for his beautiful lyrics
and poems have appeared in the periodicals of both countries. His slight
volume, <i>Low Tide on Grand-Pré</i> (1893), is published in this country by
Mr Nutt. About half of the <i>Songs from Vagabondia</i> (written in
collaboration with Mr Richard Hovey) are of his authorship. This book,
published in 1894 by Messrs Stone &amp; Kimball of Chicago, is to be had
here through Mr Elkin Mathews. It is from the <i>Songs</i> that the stirring
war-chant of “Gamelbar” comes.</p>

<p class="nind2">ELLEN MACKAY HUTCHINSON.<br /><a href="#page_361">PAGE 361</a></p>

<p>This distinguished American lady is descended from old Highland stock. I
know of no other book by her than <i>Songs and Lyrics</i> (Boston, Osgood &amp;
Co., 1881), but that is one which all lovers of poetry should possess.
Miss Hutchinson’s name is best known in connection with that colossal
and invaluable work, the <i>Cyclopædia of American Literature</i> (eleven
vols.), in which she was the collaborator of Mr Edmund Clarence Stedman.</p>

<p class="nind2">HUGH M‘CULLOCH.<br /><a href="#page_364">PAGE 364</a></p>

<p>This descendant of an old Highland family is the author of <i>The Quest of
Heracles</i> (Stone &amp; Kimball, Chicago, 1894).</p>

<p class="nind2">DUNCAN CAMPBELL SCOTT.<br /><a href="#page_365">PAGE 365</a></p>

<p>Mr Scott is a member of one of the many Scoto-Celtic families settled in
Canada. He was born at Ottawa in 1862, and is the author of <i>The Magic
House</i> (1893).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_450" id="page_450">{450}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind2">THOMAS D’ARCY M‘CGEE. (1821-1868.)<br /><a href="#page_366">PAGE 366</a></p>

<p>This distinguished Irishman is to be accounted only an adopted American.
He emigrated to the States in 1842, edited <i>The Boston Pilot</i>, and in
1857 went to Montreal and entered the Canadian Parliament. It was when
returning from a night-session that he was assassinated in Ottawa by
Fenian malcontents.</p>

<p class="nind2">
MARY C. G. GILLINGTON (MRS BYRON) AND ALICE E. GILLINGTON.<br />      <a href="#page_368">PAGES 368-373</a><br />
</p>

<p>These two sisters, whose names have become so deservedly well-known by
their contributions to British and American periodicals, are of Celtic
blood, though born and resident in England. They are included here as
representative of the Anglo Celtic strain so potent in England itself.
The elder, Mrs Byron, was born in Cheshire in 1861. Their joint volume,
<i>Poems</i>, was published in 1892. Mr Elkin Mathews has just published a
volume entitled, <i>A Little Book of Lyrics</i>, by Mrs Byron.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
